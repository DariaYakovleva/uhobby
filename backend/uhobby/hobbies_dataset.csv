0,fire poi,Poi (performance art),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art),"Poi is a skill toy. Also Poi refers to both a style of performing art and the equipment used for engaging in poi performance. As a skill toy poi is an object or theatrical prop used for dexterity play or an object manipulation. As a performance art, poi involves swinging tethered weights through a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. Poi artists may also sing or dance while swinging their poi. Poi can be made from various materials with different handles, weights, and effects (such as fire).
Poi originated with the Māori people of New Zealand, where it is still practiced today. Poi has also gained a following in many other countries. The expansion of poi culture has led to a significant evolution of the styles practiced, the tools used, and the definition of the word ""poi.""

3,ice hockey,Ice hockey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey,"Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in an indoor or outdoor rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score goals. The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually fielding six players at a time: one goaltender to stop the puck from going into their own net, two defensemen, and three forwards who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck and score goals against the opposing team.
Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and the United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada. In addition, ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the highest level for men's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the highest league in Russia and much of Eastern Europe. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey, with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking. Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries.In Canada, the United States, Nordic countries, and some other European countries the sport is known simply as hockey; the name ""ice hockey"" is used in places where ""hockey"" more often refers to field hockey, such as countries in South America, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and some European countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands.Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Scotland and elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as shinny and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF, and the sport was played for the first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer Olympics. Despite women having played since the beginnings of the game, women's hockey was not professionally organised until much later, the first IIHF Women's World Championship being held in 1990 and being introduced into the Olympics in 1998.
In international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the Big Six) predominate: Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual Ice Hockey World Championships, 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953. The World Cup of Hockey is organized by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 IIHF World Women's Championship medals were awarded to one of the Big Six. The Canadian national team or the United States national team have between them won every gold medal of either series.","All Wikipedia articles written in Canadian English,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with dead external links,Articles lacking reliable references from July 2021,Articles with dead external links from July 2018,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 Dutch-language sources (nl),CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Canadian culture,Commons category link from Wikidata,Former Summer Olympic sports,Hockey,Ice hockey,Ice skating,Ice sports,National symbols of Canada,Pages with missing ISBNs,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in Canada,Team sports,Use Canadian English from September 2016,Use mdy dates from May 2018,Variations of hockey,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia pending changes protected pages,Winter Olympic sports,Winter sports",Ice hockey,Хоккей,"0.0124,0.0134,0.0465,0.0236,0.0134,0.0168,0.0334,0.0241,0.0192,0.0202,0.0285,0.0119,0.0509,0.0129,0.0124,0.0124,0.0129,0.5582,0.0441,0.0324",https://images.pexels.com/photos/40564/ice-hockey-players-pass-forward-40564.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The sport can either be genuinely competitive or sportive entertainment (see professional wrestling). Wrestling comes in different types such as folkstyle, freestyle, Greco-Roman, catch, submission, judo, sambo and others. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.

5,strategy games,Strategy game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_game,"A strategy game or strategic game is a game (e.g. a board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous, decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome. Almost all strategy games require internal decision tree-style thinking, and typically very high situational awareness.

Strategy games are also seen as a descendant of war games, and define strategy in terms of the context of war, but this is more partial. A strategy game is a game that relies primarily on strategy, and when it comes to defining what strategy is, two factors need to be taken into account: its complexity and game-scale actions, such as each placement in a Total War series. The definition of a strategy game in its cultural context should be any game that belongs to a tradition that goes back to war games, contains more strategy than the average video game, contains certain gameplay conventions, and is represented by a particular community. Although war is dominant in strategy games, it is not the whole story.

6,archaeology,Archaeology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology,"Archaeology or archeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. Archaeology is often considered a branch of socio-cultural anthropology, but archaeologists also draw from biological, geological, and environmental systems through their study of the past.  The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines, while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology.Archaeologists study human prehistory and history, from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades. Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology, which is the study of fossil remains. Archaeology is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies, for which, by definition, there are no written records. Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world. Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time. Derived from the Greek, the term archaeology literally means “the study of ancient history.”The discipline involves surveying, excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past. In broad scope, archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research.
Archaeology developed out of antiquarianism in Europe during the 19th century, and has since become a discipline practiced across the world. Archaeology has been used by nation-states to create particular visions of the past. Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including maritime archaeology, feminist archaeology and archaeoastronomy, and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with pseudoarchaeology, the looting of artifacts, a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains.","All Wikipedia articles written in Canadian English,All articles that may contain original research,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Anthropology,Archaeology,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles that may contain original research from March 2014,Articles with dead external links from April 2020,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2007,CS1: long volume value,CS1 Spanish-language sources (es),CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use Canadian English from August 2016,Use dmy dates from April 2018,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2021,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages",Archaeology,Археология,"0.0436,0.0169,0.0158,0.2619,0.0481,0.0247,0.0197,0.0231,0.0319,0.0608,0.0208,0.0169,0.2353,0.0186,0.0214,0.0353,0.0369,0.0147,0.0258,0.0275",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3722335/pexels-photo-3722335.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Professor Randall Rhoades of Ashland, Ohio, coined a word in 1945 that became the accepted description of the study of picture postcards. It initially took about 20 years for the name to appear in a dictionary. Compared to philately, the identification of a postcard's place and time of production can often be an impossible task because postcards, unlike stamps, are produced in a decentralised, unregulated manner. For this reason, some collectors choose to limit their acquisitions to cards by specific artists and publishers, or by time and location.","Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles with short description,CS1 Russian-language sources (ru),Collecting,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Postcards,Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Deltiology,Филокартия,"0.0543,0.0543,0.0377,0.053,0.0377,0.0326,0.0479,0.0313,0.0517,0.0415,0.0287,0.03,0.1117,0.039,0.039,0.1398,0.0466,0.0287,0.0543,0.0402",

10,space exploration,Space exploration,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration,"Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.
While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.The early era of space exploration was driven by a ""Space Race"" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. 
After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).
With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. 
The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth–Moon L1, the Moon, Earth–Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.In the 2000s, China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program when India launched Chandraayan 1, while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions. China, Russia, and Japan have advocated crewed missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 20th and 21st century.
From the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then public space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize). Students interested in Space have formed SEDS (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space). SpaceX is currently developing Starship, a fully reusable orbital launch vehicle that is expected to massively reduce the cost of spaceflight and allow for crewed planetary exploration.","All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of May 2021,Commons category link from Wikidata,Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments,Short description is different from Wikidata,Solar System,Space exploration,Spaceflight,Use American English from September 2016,Use dmy dates from December 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Space Exploration,Исследование космоса,"0.0183,0.028,0.0234,0.135,0.0104,0.0206,0.0322,0.0377,0.016,0.0225,0.016,0.0308,0.0623,0.0174,0.0174,0.028,0.0127,0.0118,0.4373,0.0225",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1906658/pexels-photo-1906658.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

These techniques are also used to climb trees for other purposes: tree care (arborists), animal rescue, research, and activism.","All articles needing additional references,Articles needing additional references from June 2018,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Trees,Types of climbing",Tree climbing,Лазания по деревьям,"0.0291,0.0302,0.0429,0.0683,0.0513,0.0291,0.0344,0.0323,0.0354,0.0767,0.1328,0.0238,0.0238,0.1741,0.0407,0.0344,0.0481,0.0344,0.0312,0.027",https://images.pexels.com/photos/691034/pexels-photo-691034.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
14,tetris,Tetris,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra,"Tetra is the common name of many small freshwater characiform fishes. Tetras come from Africa, Central America, and South America, belonging to the biological family Characidae and to its former subfamilies Alestidae (the ""African tetras"") and Lebiasinidae. The Characidae are distinguished from other fish by the presence of a small adipose fin between the dorsal and caudal fins. Many of these, such as the neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi), are brightly colored and easy to keep in captivity.  Consequently, they are extremely popular for home aquaria.
Tetra is no longer a taxonomic, phylogenetic term. It is short for Tetragonopterus, a genus name formerly applied to many of these fish, which is Greek for ""square-finned"" (literally, four-sided-wing).
Because of the popularity of tetras in the fishkeeping hobby, many unrelated fish are commonly known as tetras, including species from different families. Even vastly different fish may be called tetras. For example, payara (Hydrolycus scomberoides) is occasionally known as the ""sabretooth tetra"" or ""vampire tetra"".
Tetras generally have compressed (sometimes deep), fusiform bodies and are typically identifiable by their fins. They ordinarily possess a homocercal caudal fin (a twin-lobed, or forked, tail fin whose upper and lower lobes are of equal size) and a tall dorsal fin characterized by a short connection to the fish's body. Additionally, tetras possess a long anal fin stretching from a position just posterior of the dorsal fin and ending on the ventral caudal peduncle, and a small, fleshy adipose fin located dorsally between the dorsal and caudal fins. This adipose fin represents the fourth unpaired fin on the fish (the four unpaired fins are the caudal fin, dorsal fin, anal fin, and adipose fin), lending to the name tetra, which is Greek for four. While this adipose fin is generally considered the distinguishing feature, some tetras (such as the emperor tetras, Nematobrycon palmeri) lack this appendage. Ichthyologists debate the function of the adipose fin, doubting its role in swimming due to its small size and lack of stiffening rays or spines.Although the list below is sorted by common name, in a number of cases, the common name is applied to different species. Since the aquarium trade may use a different name for the same species, advanced aquarists tend to use scientific names for the less-common tetras. The list below is incomplete.

15,existentialism,Existentialism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism,"Existentialism
( or ) is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the problem of human existence and centers on the experience of thinking, feeling, and acting. In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point has been called ""the existential angst,"" a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.Existentialism is associated with several 19th and 20th-century European philosophers who shared an emphasis on the human subject, despite profound doctrinal differences. Many existentialists regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience. A primary virtue in existentialist thought is authenticity. Søren Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher. He proposed that each individual—not society or religion—is solely responsible for giving meaning to life and living it passionately and sincerely, or ""authentically"".Furthermore, existentialism has influenced many disciplines outside of philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.","19th-century philosophy,20th-century philosophy,All articles that are too technical,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with French-language sources (fr),Articles with Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy links,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020,CS1 errors: missing periodical,Criticism of rationalism,Existentialism,Individualism,Metaphysical theories,Modernism,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Philosophical movements,Philosophy of life,Short description is different from Wikidata,Social theories,Wikipedia articles that are too technical from November 2020,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia external links cleanup from September 2015,Wikipedia spam cleanup from September 2015",Existentialism,Экзистенциализм,"0.0543,0.0318,0.0189,0.337,0.0608,0.039,0.0302,0.0197,0.0358,0.031,0.0455,0.0181,0.027,0.0374,0.0286,0.0382,0.0552,0.0238,0.0407,0.027",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8720232/pexels-photo-8720232.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

19,dowsing,Dowsing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Dowding,"Air Chief Marshal Hugh Caswall Tremenheere Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding,  (24 April 1882 – 15 February 1970) was an officer in the Royal Air Force. He was Air Officer Commanding RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain and is generally credited with playing a crucial role in Britain's defence, and hence, the defeat of Adolf Hitler's plan to invade Britain.
Born in Moffat, Scotland, Dowding was an officer in the British Army in the 1900s and early 1910s. He joined the Royal Flying Corps at the start of the First World War and went on to serve as a fighter pilot and then as commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron. During the inter-war years he became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, Air Defence of Great Britain and then joined the Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Research. In July 1936, Dowding was appointed chief of the newly created RAF Fighter Command.
During the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, Dowding's Fighter Command successfully defended the UK against the attacks of the Luftwaffe, thanks to his prudent management of RAF resources and detailed preparation of Britain's air defences (the Dowding system). He subsequently came into conflict with proponents of the Big Wing tactic, most notably Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Douglas Bader, which along with the inadaquecies of RAF's nighttime defence during the Blitz led to his eventual downfall. In November 1940, Dowding was replaced in command against his wishes by Sholto Douglas, another Big Wing advocate.
Dowding retired from the Royal Air Force in July 1942 and was made a peer in June 1943. He died on 15 February 1970, aged 87.","1882 births,1970 deaths,Aerial warfare pioneers,Anti-vivisectionists,Articles with short description,Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom,Battle of Britain,British Army personnel of World War I,Burials at Westminster Abbey,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,Commons category link from Wikidata,Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George,Graduates of the Royal Military Academy,Woolwich,Graduates of the Staff College,Camberley,Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath,Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order,Pages containing London Gazette template with parameter supp set to y,Parapsychologists,Peers created by George VI,""People educated at St Ninians School,Moffat"",People educated at Winchester College,People from Moffat,Royal Air Force air marshals of World War II,Royal Air Force generals of World War I,Royal Flying Corps officers,Royal Garrison Artillery officers,Scottish Theosophists,Scottish aviators,Scottish spiritualists,Short description matches Wikidata,Use British English from March 2021,Use dmy dates from June 2020,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with ISNI identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NTA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers,Wikipedia articles with SUDOC identifiers,Wikipedia articles with Trove identifiers,Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers",Dowsing,Лозоходство,"0.0264,0.0282,0.0264,0.0865,0.0363,0.0202,0.2487,0.0318,0.0354,0.0497,0.0228,0.0694,0.0372,0.047,0.022,0.0228,0.0336,0.0372,0.0211,0.0972",
20,audiophilia,Audiophile,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiophile,"An audiophile is a person who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. An audiophile seeks to reproduce the sound of a live musical performance, typically in a room with good acoustics. It is widely agreed that reaching this goal is very difficult and that even the best-regarded recording and playback systems rarely, if ever, achieve it.Audiophile values may be applied at all stages of music reproduction: the initial audio recording, the production process, and the playback, which is usually in a home setting. In general, the values of an audiophile are seen to be antithetical to the growing popularity of more convenient but lower quality music, especially lossy digital file types like MP3, lower definition streaming services, and inexpensive headphones.The term high-end audio refers to playback equipment used by audiophiles, which may be bought at specialist shops and websites. High-end components include turntables, digital-to-analog converters, equalization devices, preamplifiers and amplifiers (both solid-state and vacuum tube), loudspeakers (including horn, electrostatic and magnetostatic speakers), power conditioners, subwoofers, headphones, and acoustic room treatment in addition to room correction devices.Although many audiophile techniques are based on objective criteria that can be verified using techniques like ABX testing, perceived sound quality is necessarily subjective, leading to some more controversial audiophile techniques being based on pseudoscientific, magical or paranormal principles.

22,saltwater aquariums,Marine aquarium,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_aquarium,"A marine aquarium is an aquarium that keeps marine plants and animals in a contained environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria. Fish only tanks often showcase large or aggressive marine fish species and generally rely on mechanical and chemical filtration. FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons harboring beneficial nitrogen waste metabolizing bacteria, as a means of more natural biological filtration.
Marine fishkeeping is different from its freshwater counterpart because of the fundamental differences in the constitution of saltwater and the resulting differences in the adaptation of its inhabitants. A stable marine aquarium requires more equipment than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring. The inhabitants of a marine aquarium are often difficult to acquire and are usually more expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants.","All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with dead external links from June 2017,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Fishkeeping,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Saltwater Aquariums,Соленые аквариумы,"0.0241,0.0231,0.0624,0.0487,0.0251,0.032,0.0221,0.031,0.0349,0.0428,0.0398,0.0388,0.0487,0.1244,0.0261,0.2139,0.0329,0.0221,0.0565,0.0506",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8837892/pexels-photo-8837892.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.
Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens, and large picnic areas, which were created for people's recreation. World's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry. Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest, continuously-operating amusement park in North America. The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946, Santa's Workshop in 1949, and Disneyland in 1955.","All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Amusement parks,Articles with dead external links from July 2017,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,""Childrens entertainment"",Commons category link is on Wikidata,Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Amusement park,Парк развлечений,"0.0414,0.024,0.0248,0.0366,0.0445,0.0414,0.0406,0.0406,0.0193,0.0319,0.0319,0.0264,0.0366,0.0453,0.0232,0.0225,0.34,0.0493,0.0571,0.0225",https://images.pexels.com/photos/136412/pexels-photo-136412.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Snorkeling is a popular recreational activity, particularly at tropical resort locations. It provides the opportunity to observe underwater life in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for scuba diving. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort is involved and is the basis of the two surface disciplines of the underwater sport of finswimming.Snorkeling is also used by scuba divers when on the surface, in underwater sports such as underwater hockey and underwater rugby, and as part of water-based searches conducted by search and rescue teams.","All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2016,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list,Commons category link from Wikidata,Freediving,Individual sports,Recreational diving,Short description matches Wikidata,Swimming,Use American English from March 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from February 2019,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2019,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Snorkeling,Сноркелинг,"0.0232,0.0241,0.0314,0.0733,0.0278,0.025,0.0433,0.0232,0.026,0.2609,0.0815,0.0214,0.036,0.0296,0.0241,0.0542,0.0751,0.0496,0.0496,0.0205",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2404365/pexels-photo-2404365.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with failed verification,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from March 2017,Articles with failed verification from February 2013,Articles with short description,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Cooking,Home economics,Short description is different from Wikidata,Survival skills,Use dmy dates from May 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Cooking,Готовка,"0.0203,0.0328,0.0361,0.0435,0.0593,0.0361,0.0692,0.0468,0.0245,0.0311,0.0228,0.0261,0.2691,0.0195,0.0369,0.0742,0.0709,0.0195,0.0402,0.0211",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1435895/pexels-photo-1435895.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

30,hairstyle,Hairstyle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle,"A hairstyle, hairdo, or haircut refers to the styling of hair, usually on the human scalp. Sometimes, this could also mean an editing of facial or body hair. The fashioning of hair can be considered an aspect of personal grooming, fashion, and cosmetics, although practical, cultural, and popular considerations also influence some hairstyles.The oldest known depiction of hair styling is hair braiding which dates back about 30,000 years. In history, women's hair was often elaborately and carefully dressed in special ways, though it was also often kept covered outside the home, especially for married women. From the time of the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, most women grew their hair as long as it would naturally grow. Between the late 15th century and the 16th century, a very high hairline on the forehead was considered attractive. Around the same time period, European men often wore their hair cropped no longer than shoulder-length. In the early 17th century, male hairstyles grew longer, with waves or curls being considered desirable.
The male wig was pioneered by King Louis XIII of France (1601–1643) in 1624. Mullets or periwigs for men were introduced into the English-speaking world with other French styles in 1660. Late 17th century wigs were very long and wavy, but became shorter in the mid-18th century, by which time they were normally white. Short hair for fashionable men was a product of the Neoclassical movement. In the early 19th century the male beard, and also moustaches and sideburns, made a strong reappearance. From the 16th to the 19th century, European women's hair became more visible while their hair coverings grew smaller. In the middle of the 18th century the pouf style developed. During the First World War, women around the world started to shift to shorter hairstyles that were easier to manage. In the early 1950s women's hair was generally curled and worn in a variety of styles and lengths. In the 1960s, many women began to wear their hair in short modern cuts such as the pixie cut, while in the 1970s, hair tended to be longer and looser. In both the 1960s and 1970s many men and women wore their hair very long and straight. In the 1980s, women pulled back their hair with scrunchies. During the 1980s, punk hairstyles were adopted by many people.","All articles needing additional references,All articles needing rewrite,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from December 2020,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2014,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Duplicate articles,Hairdressing,Hairstyles,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from June 2015,Wikipedia articles needing rewrite from December 2020,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Hairstyle,Парикмахерское искусство,"0.0142,0.0395,0.0212,0.0132,0.2166,0.1232,0.0153,0.0539,0.0486,0.0448,0.0421,0.0185,0.0894,0.0464,0.0346,0.0255,0.0148,0.0996,0.0185,0.0201",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3993465/pexels-photo-3993465.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The results are often displayed in charts or written as narratives.

In the narrow sense, a ""genealogy"" or a ""family tree"" traces the descendants of one person, whereas a ""family history"" traces the ancestors of one person, but the terms are often used interchangeably. A family history may include additional biographical information, family traditions, and the like.The pursuit of family history and origins tends to be shaped by several motives, including the desire to carve out a place for one's family in the larger historical picture, a sense of responsibility to preserve the past for future generations, and self-satisfaction in accurate storytelling.

36,sculpture,Sculpture,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture,"Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast.
Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa.
The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's statue of David. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished art works.","All articles with dead external links,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles with dead external links from May 2018,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,CS1 errors: missing periodical,Commons link is on Wikidata,Sculpture,Sculpture techniques,Sculptures,Short description is different from Wikidata,Visual arts terminology,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with IEU identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Sculpture,Скульптура,"0.0203,0.0242,0.0255,0.0352,0.4002,0.03,0.0242,0.021,0.0359,0.0262,0.0229,0.0462,0.125,0.0378,0.0197,0.0262,0.0197,0.0152,0.0158,0.0287",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7245252/pexels-photo-7245252.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members.

44,racquetball,Racquetball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racquetball,"Racquetball is a racquet sport played with a hollow rubber ball on an indoor or outdoor court. Joseph Sobek is credited with inventing the modern sport of racquetball in 1950, adding a stringed racquet to paddleball in order to increase velocity and control. Unlike most racquet sports, such as tennis and badminton, there is no net to hit the ball over, and, unlike squash, no tin (out of bounds area at the bottom of front wall) to hit the ball above. Also, the court's walls, floor, and ceiling are legal playing surfaces, with the exception of court-specific designated hinders being out-of-bounds.Racquetball is very similar to 40×20 American handball, which is played in many countries. It is also very similar to the British sport Squash 57, which was called racketball before 2016 (see below for a comparison).

47,shark fishing,"United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Approximately_64,695_Pounds_of_Shark_Fins","United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins (520 F.3d 976) is a 2008 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning civil forfeiture in admiralty law. Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a three-judge panel that ordered that the shark fins be returned to their owners, reversing a decision by the Southern District of California. The government did not appeal the case further.
The case began in 2002 when a Coast Guard crew working from a Navy ship stopped and searched the King Diamond II, a U.S.-flagged, Hong Kong-based vessel in international waters off the coast of Guatemala. On board the ship they found shark fins, equivalent to 32.3 tons (29.3 tonnes) but without any corresponding shark carcasses. The Coast Guard, upon further investigation, found documentary evidence that the KD II had arranged to meet fishing vessels at predetermined locations and buy various quantities of fins. These activities were believed to violate the Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000 (SFPA). The fins were thus seized and the ship escorted to San Diego, the nearest American port.
Federal agencies filed charges against the KD II's owner, operator and captain. They further sought forfeiture of the fins under in rem jurisdiction, resulting in the unusual case title. Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the order in 2005. The boat's owners appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed Moskowitz three years later. It held that the seizure was illegal: the KD II's activities did not meet the definition of a fishing vessel under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins could not have been lawfully seized on the high seas. In 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law, which closed these loopholes.","2008 in United States case law,2008 in the environment,Articles with short description,Good articles,Shark finning,Short description matches Wikidata,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases,United States admiralty case law,United States civil forfeiture case law,United States environmental case law,United States in rem cases,United States statutory interpretation case law",Shark Fishing,Рыбалка на акул,"0.0534,0.02,0.0381,0.0403,0.0301,0.0214,0.065,0.0396,0.0389,0.0214,0.0439,0.0163,0.0556,0.0294,0.0207,0.3046,0.0432,0.0359,0.028,0.0541",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8837944/pexels-photo-8837944.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

50,buddhism,Buddhism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism,"Buddhism (, US: ) is an Indian religion based on a series of original teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha. It originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, spreading through much of Asia. It is the world's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers, or over 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists. Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on the Buddha's teachings (born Siddhārtha Gautama in the 5th or 4th century BCE) and resulting interpreted philosophies.
As expressed in the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, the goal of Buddhism is to overcome suffering (duḥkha) caused by desire and ignorance of reality's true nature, including impermanence (anicca) and the non-existence of the self (anattā). Most Buddhist traditions emphasize transcending the individual self through the attainment of Nirvana or by following the path of Buddhahood, ending the cycle of death and rebirth. Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation, the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts, and their specific teachings and practices. Widely observed practices include meditation, observance of moral precepts, monasticism, taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, and the cultivation of the Paramitas (perfections, or virtues).
Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravāda (Pali: ""The School of the Elders"") and Mahāyāna (Sanskrit: ""The Great Vehicle""). Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. Mahayana, which includes the traditions of Zen, Pure Land, Nichiren Buddhism, Tiantai Buddhism (Tendai), and Shingon, is practiced prominently in Nepal, Malaysia, Bhutan, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Vajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts, may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India, is practised in the countries of the Himalayan region, Mongolia, and Kalmykia.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with incomplete citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Pali-language text,Articles containing Sanskrit-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010,Articles lacking reliable references from September 2019,Articles with incomplete citations from October 2020,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2020,Buddhism,CS1: long volume value,EngvarB from August 2019,Gautama Buddha,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Indian religions,Moksha-aligned dharmas,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Pages with missing ISBNs,Short description matches Wikidata,Transtheism,Use dmy dates from August 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from March 2015,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from October 2020,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with TDVİA identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages,Āstika",Buddhism,Буддизм,"0.1341,0.0614,0.0422,0.095,0.1725,0.0237,0.0168,0.0408,0.0326,0.0291,0.0456,0.0209,0.0374,0.0552,0.0195,0.025,0.0189,0.0394,0.0429,0.047",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6957069/pexels-photo-6957069.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
51,billiards,Cue sports,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sports,"Cue sports (sometimes written cuesports), also known as billiard sports, 
are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick, which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as cushions.

Historically, the umbrella term was billiards. While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in British and Australian English, billiards usually refers exclusively to the game of English billiards, while in American and Canadian English it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon dialect and context. In colloquial usage, the term billiards may be used to refer to games such as pool, snooker, or Russian pyramid.
There are three major subdivisions of games within cue sports:

Carom billiards, referring to games played on tables without pockets, typically 10 feet in length, including straight rail, balkline, one-cushion carom, three-cushion billiards, artistic billiards and four-ball
Pool, covering numerous pocket billiards games generally played on six-pocket tables of 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-foot length, including among others eight-ball (the world's most widely played cue sport), nine-ball (the dominant professional game), ten-ball, straight pool (the formerly dominant pro game), one-pocket, and bank pool
Snooker, English billiards and Russian pyramid, games played on a billiards table with six pockets called a snooker table (which has dimensions just under 12 ft by 6 ft), all of which are classified entirely separately from pool based on a separate historical development, as well as a separate culture and terminology that characterize their play.There are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.
Billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of Mary, Queen of Scots, in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of Shakespeare, including the famous line ""let's to billiards"" in Antony and Cleopatra (1606–07), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: Mozart, Louis XIV of France, Marie Antoinette, Immanuel Kant, Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, George Washington, French president Jules Grévy, Charles Dickens, George Armstrong Custer, Theodore Roosevelt, Lewis Carroll, W.C. Fields, Babe Ruth, Bob Hope, and Jackie Gleason.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing Italian-language text,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 maint: extra text: authors list,Commons link is locally defined,Cue sports,French inventions,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports entertainment,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from September 2011,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Billiards,Бильярд,"0.0122,0.0126,0.0136,0.0203,0.0632,0.0117,0.0379,0.0165,0.0427,0.0327,0.0656,0.0155,0.0236,0.0179,0.0265,0.0145,0.0346,0.2787,0.0141,0.2458",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5044122/pexels-photo-5044122.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The growing of grapes is viticulture and there are many varieties of grapes.
Winemaking can be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without carbonation) and sparkling wine production (with carbonation – natural or injected). Red wine, white wine, and rosé are the other main categories. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other plants. (See fruit wine.)

55,chess,Chess,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess,"Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games of Indian and Persian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.
Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in ""check"") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.
One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than even the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.","Abstract strategy games,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles containing Sanskrit-language text,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,CS1: long volume value,CS1 French-language sources (fr),Chess,Games related to chaturanga,Indian inventions,Individual sports,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Partially solved games,Short description is different from Wikidata,Spoken articles,Traditional board games,Use dmy dates from June 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia articles with TDVİA identifiers,Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism",Chess,Шахматы,"0.0701,0.0382,0.0327,0.0388,0.0343,0.0472,0.0243,0.0276,0.0824,0.0131,0.0427,0.0461,0.0461,0.0131,0.0472,0.0288,0.0221,0.2789,0.0405,0.026",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6114986/pexels-photo-6114986.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

57,mahjong,Mahjong,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong,"Mahjong or mah-jongg (English pronunciation:  mah-JONG, Mandarin Chinese: [mǎ.tɕjâŋ]) is a tile-based game that was developed in the 19th century in China and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in parts of China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have also become popular in Western countries. The game has also been adapted into a widespread online entertainment. Similar to the Western card game rummy, Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and luck.
The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four melds (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. While many variations of mahjong exist, most variations have some basic rules in common including how a piece is drawn and discarded, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of suits (numbered tiles) and honors (winds and dragons), the basic kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Beyond these basic common rules, numerous regional variations exist which may have notably different criteria for legal melds and winning hands, radically different scoring systems and even elaborate extra rules. A group of players may introduce their own house rules which can notably change the feel of play.","1920s fads and trends,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles containing Khmer-language text,Articles containing Korean-language text,Articles containing Thai-language text,Articles containing Vietnamese-language text,Articles containing simplified Chinese-language text,Articles containing traditional Chinese-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2014,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),Chinese games,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Gambling games,Interlanguage link template forcing interwiki links,Mahjong,Pages using template Zh with sup tags,Short description is different from Wikidata,Short description matches Wikidata,Traditional board games,Use dmy dates from March 2014,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Mahjong,Маджонг,"0.0627,0.0215,0.0147,0.0303,0.0415,0.0309,0.0446,0.0247,0.0278,0.0228,0.0259,0.0272,0.0527,0.0197,0.2269,0.0197,0.0253,0.2338,0.0178,0.0297",https://unsplash.com/photos/nxizznysgXI/download

59,working in a food pantry,Pantry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry,"Pastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening (solid fats, including butter or lard) that may be savoury or sweetened. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery. The word ""pastries"" suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and pasties.The French word pâtisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) for the same foods. Originally, the French word pastisserie referred to anything, such as a meat pie, made in dough (paste, later pâte) and not typically a luxurious or sweet product. This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century, though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today.
Pastry can also refer to the pastry dough, from which such baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products.
Pastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture.  A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for yeast bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.","Articles containing French-language text,Articles with short description,CS1 errors: bare URL,CS1 errors: missing title,Pastries,Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers",Working In A Food Pantry,Работа в пищевой кладовой,"0.0127,0.0186,0.0283,0.0143,0.0165,0.0143,0.0159,0.0159,0.0138,0.0148,0.0326,0.0224,0.0715,0.0337,0.147,0.4264,0.0305,0.0159,0.0294,0.0256",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3771079/pexels-photo-3771079.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk  is often a part of the experience.This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.

Since the balloon moves with the direction of the winds, the  passengers feel absolutely no wind, except for brief periods during the  flight when the balloon climbs or descends into air currents of different direction or speed.
Hot air ballooning has been recognized by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) as the safest air sport in aviation, and fatalities in hot air balloon accidents are rare, according to statistics from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

64,cycling,Cycling,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling,"Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"", ""bicyclists"", or ""bikers"". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.
Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.
Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion. These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles. Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery. Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles, often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.","Aerobic exercise,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking reliable references from November 2010,Articles prone to spam from June 2012,Articles with dead external links from July 2019,Articles with dead external links from September 2019,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015,Cycling,Emissions reduction,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sustainable transport,Symbols of Illinois,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from March 2015,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Cycling,Езда на велосипеде,"0.0138,0.0109,0.0109,0.0128,0.0109,0.0118,0.0114,0.778,0.0109,0.0114,0.0133,0.0118,0.0118,0.0109,0.0114,0.0114,0.0109,0.0128,0.0114,0.0118",https://images.pexels.com/photos/128202/pexels-photo-128202.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Each layer is sealed with varnishes (often multiple coats) until the ""stuck on"" appearance disappears and the result looks like painting or inlay work. The traditional technique used 30 to 40 layers of varnish which were then sanded to a polished finish.Three dimensional decoupage (sometimes also referred to simply as decoupage) is the art of creating a three-dimensional (3D) image by cutting out elements of varying sizes from a series of identical images and layering them on top of each other, usually with adhesive foam spacers between each layer to give the image more depth.
Pyramid decoupage (also called pyramage) is a process similar to 3D decoupage. In pyramid decoupage, a series of identical images are cut into progressively smaller, identical shapes which are layered and fixed with adhesive foam spacers to create a 3D ""pyramid"" effect.","All articles lacking in-text citations,Articles lacking in-text citations from June 2015,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Crafts,Decorative arts,Paper art,Short description is different from Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Decoupage,Декупаж,"0.0186,0.0247,0.0597,0.027,0.1442,0.0247,0.0263,0.0194,0.0544,0.024,0.0194,0.0186,0.0407,0.0285,0.3231,0.0301,0.043,0.0202,0.0179,0.0354",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4124811/pexels-photo-4124811.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

68,animal,Animal,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal,"Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, containing both the echinoderms as well as the chordates, the latter containing the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.
Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.
Humans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,Animals,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2013,""Articles with species microformats"",Articles with short description,CS1: long volume value,CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 Latin-language sources (la),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Cryogenian first appearances,Good articles,Kingdoms (biology),Short description is different from Wikidata,Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus,Use British English from April 2017,Use dmy dates from September 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Animal,Животные,"0.043,0.0219,0.0707,0.0471,0.0548,0.0198,0.0224,0.0249,0.0255,0.0522,0.0322,0.0147,0.1016,0.3413,0.0239,0.0152,0.0352,0.0157,0.0188,0.0193",https://images.pexels.com/photos/87403/cheetah-leopard-animal-big-87403.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

70,dominoes,Dominoes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes,"Dominoes is a family of tile-based games played with gaming pieces, commonly known as dominoes. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends. Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called pips or dots) or is blank. The backs of the tiles in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. The gaming pieces make up a domino set, sometimes called a deck or pack.  The traditional European domino set consists of 28 tiles, also known as pieces, bones, rocks, stones, men, cards or just dominoes, featuring all combinations of spot counts between zero and six. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to playing cards or dice, in that a variety of games can be played with a set.

The earliest mention of dominoes is from Song dynasty China found in the text Former Events in Wulin by Zhou Mi (1232–1298). Modern dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, but they differ from Chinese dominoes in a number of respects, and there is no confirmed link between the two. European dominoes may have developed independently, or Italian missionaries in China may have brought the game to Europe.The name ""domino"" is probably derived from the resemblance to a kind of carnival costume worn during the Venetian Carnival, often consisting of a black-hooded robe and a white mask. Despite the coinage of the word ""polyomino"" as a generalization, there is no connection between the word ""domino"" and the number 2 in any language.
The most commonly played domino games are Domino Whist, Matador, and Muggins (All Fives). Other popular forms include Texas 42, Chicken Foot, Concentration, Double Fives, and Mexican Train. In Britain, the most popular league and pub game is Fives and Threes.","All Wikipedia articles in need of updating,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles needing additional references from February 2020,Articles needing additional references from June 2018,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2019,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh),Chinese inventions,Commons category link from Wikidata,Domino games,Dominoes,Gambling games,Gaming devices,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Pub games,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from November 2016,Wikipedia articles in need of updating from February 2020,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from February 2020",Dominoes,Домино,"0.0399,0.0412,0.052,0.0201,0.0425,0.0348,0.1389,0.0169,0.0361,0.0405,0.022,0.0163,0.0616,0.0291,0.0878,0.0169,0.1587,0.1044,0.0246,0.0156",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8102738/pexels-photo-8102738.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
71,wall art,Wall,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well,"A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water. The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers. The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well. Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India. Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age.
Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is the case in rural areas of the developing world. These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water. Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole. Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.
Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath. A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material. The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. Water may be pumped or hand drawn. Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable. Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.","All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Archaeological features,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2013,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2016,Bodies of water,Commons category link is on Wikidata,In situ geotechnical investigations,Short description is different from Wikidata,Vague or ambiguous time from May 2016,Water supply infrastructure,Water wells,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2021,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers",Wall Art,Настенное искусство,"0.0208,0.0119,0.0619,0.018,0.0497,0.018,0.0404,0.0231,0.017,0.0324,0.0296,0.0493,0.0427,0.0198,0.0791,0.0437,0.3756,0.0147,0.0343,0.018",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1070534/pexels-photo-1070534.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
72,kayaking,Kayaking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayaking,"Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving over water. It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.

73,singing in choir,Choir,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir,"A choir (; also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.
A body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus. The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the choir) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is far from rigid. Choirs may sing without instrumental accompaniment, with the accompaniment of a piano or pipe organ, with a small ensemble (e.g., harpsichord, cello and double bass for a Baroque piece), or with a full orchestra of 70 to 100 musicians.
The term choir has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the ""woodwind choir"" of an orchestra, or different ""choirs"" of voices or instruments in a polychoral composition. In typical 18th- to 21st-century oratorios and masses, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.","All articles needing additional references,All articles to be expanded,Articles needing additional references from July 2020,Articles to be expanded from April 2020,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Choirs,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Short description matches Wikidata,Spoken articles,Types of musical groups,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia external links cleanup from July 2020,Wikipedia spam cleanup from July 2020",Singing In Choir,Пение в хоре,"0.0372,0.0226,0.0218,0.0318,0.0379,0.0579,0.0433,0.0188,0.3559,0.0188,0.041,0.041,0.0402,0.0203,0.0211,0.0333,0.0663,0.0241,0.031,0.0356",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7520086/pexels-photo-7520086.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

75,oil painting,Oil painting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_painting,"Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. The paint could be thinned with Turpentine. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss. The paint itself can be molded into different textures from the plasticity that it contains. Before oil painting was fully discovered egg tempera was commonly used. Tempera did not have the flexibility in pigment that oil paints provided.
The oldest known oil paintings were created by Buddhist artists in Afghanistan and date back to the 7th century AD. The technique of binding pigments in oil eventually made its way to Europe by at least the 12th century. The adoption of oil paint by Europeans began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of previously favored tempera paints in the majority of Europe.","All articles needing additional references,Articles needing additional references from September 2011,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Early Netherlandish art,Netherlandish Gothic art,Netherlandish Renaissance art,Oil paintings,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from October 2020,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers",Oil painting,Масляная живопись,"0.021,0.0162,0.048,0.0342,0.4607,0.03,0.019,0.0238,0.0183,0.0155,0.0369,0.0445,0.0549,0.0328,0.0376,0.0335,0.0176,0.0183,0.021,0.0162",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1045299/pexels-photo-1045299.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

78,crossbow,Crossbow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow,"A crossbow is a ranged weapon using an elastic launching device consisting of a bow-like assembly called a prod, mounted horizontally on a main frame called a tiller, which is hand-held in a similar fashion to the stock of a long firearm.  Crossbows shoot arrow-like projectiles called bolts or quarrels.  A person who shoots crossbow is called a crossbowman or an arbalist (after the arbalest, a European crossbow variant used during the 12th century).Although crossbows and bows use the same launch principle, the difference is that an archer must maintain a bow's draw manually by pitching the bowstring with fingers, pulling it back with arm and back muscles and then holding that same form in order to aim (which distresses the body and demands significant physical strength and stamina); while a crossbow utilizes a locking mechanism to maintain the draw, limiting the shooter's exertion to only pulling the string into lock and then releasing the shot via depressing a lever/trigger.  This not only enables a crossbowman to handle stronger draw weight, but also to hold for longer with significantly less physical strain, thus potentially achieving better precision.
Historically, crossbows played a significant role in the warfare of East Asia and Europe. The earliest known crossbows were invented in the first millennium BC, not later than the 7th century BC in ancient China, not later than the 4th century BC in Greece (as the gastraphetes). Crossbows brought about a major shift in the role of projectile weaponry in wars, such as during Qin's unification wars and later the Han campaigns against northern nomads and western states.  The medieval European crossbow was called by many names, including ""crossbow"" itself; most of these names derived from the word ballista, an ancient Greek torsion siege engine similar in appearance but different in design principle.  The traditional bow and arrow had long been a specialized weapon that required considerable training, physical strength, and expertise to operate with any degree of practical efficiency.  Many cultures treated archers as a separate and superior warrior caste, despite usually being drawn from the common class, as their archery skill-set was essentially trained and strengthened from early childhood (similar to many cavalry-oriented cultures) and was impossible to reproduce outside a pre-established cultural tradition, which many cultures lacked.  In contrast, the crossbow was the first ranged weapon to be simple, cheap and physically undemanding enough to be operated by large numbers of untrained conscript soldiers, thus enabling virtually any military body to field a potent force of crossbowmen with little expense beyond the cost of the weapons themselves.In modern times, firearms have largely supplanted bows and crossbows as weapons of warfare.   However, crossbows still remain widely used for competitive shooting sports and hunting, or for relatively silent shooting.","All pages needing factual verification,Ancient weapons,Articles with short description,Bows (archery),CS1 Spanish-language sources (es),Chinese inventions,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Crossbows,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Heraldic charges,Medieval weapons,Renaissance-era weapons,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from June 2020,Weapons of China,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from October 2015,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from November 2020,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Crossbow,Стрельба из арбалета,"0.0173,0.0203,0.0208,0.0278,0.0199,0.026,0.3874,0.0265,0.0168,0.0383,0.0693,0.0361,0.0803,0.0326,0.0597,0.0221,0.0116,0.0234,0.0343,0.0295",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7335647/pexels-photo-7335647.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
79,darts,Darts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth,"Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.
Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.
Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.
According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes, and other life.","All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles containing potentially dated statements,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from April 2020,Articles containing potentially dated statements from November 2018,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Astronomical objects known since antiquity,Earth,Featured articles,Global natural environment,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Nature,Planets in the circumstellar habitable zone,Planets of the Solar System,Short description matches Wikidata,Solar System,Spoken articles,Terrestrial planets,Use American English from August 2019,Use dmy dates from April 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers,Wikipedia articles with TDVİA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with WorldCat-VIAF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Darts,Дартс,"0.017,0.0129,0.0619,0.0188,0.0161,0.0215,0.0206,0.0329,0.0147,0.0234,0.0274,0.0138,0.0746,0.0506,0.012,0.0134,0.0356,0.0156,0.4701,0.0469",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2930721/pexels-photo-2930721.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
80,puppetry,Puppetry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet,"A puppet is an object, often resembling a human, animal or mythical figure, that is animated or manipulated by a person called a puppeteer. The puppeteer uses movements of their hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in storytelling. Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which dates back to the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece. There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made from a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex.
Two simple types of puppets are the finger puppet, which is a tiny puppet that fits onto a single finger, and the sock puppet, which is formed and operated by inserting one's hand inside a sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's ""mouth."" The sock puppet is a type of hand puppet, which is controlled using one hand that occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around. A ""live-hand puppet"" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. A Marionette is a much more complicated type of puppet that is suspended and controlled by a number of strings connected to the head, back and limbs, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.
A rod puppet is constructed around a central rod secured to the head. A shadow puppet is a cut-out figure held between a source of light and a translucent screen. Bunraku puppets are a type of Japanese wood-carved puppet. A ventriloquist's dummy is a puppet, often human-shaped, operated by a ventriloquist performer's hand; the performer produces the puppet's voice with little or no movement of her mouth, which creates the illusion that the puppet is alive. Carnival puppets are large puppets, typically bigger than a human, designed to be part of a large spectacle or parade.

81,watercolor paintings,Watercolor painting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolor_painting,"Watercolor (American English) or watercolour (British English; see spelling differences), also aquarelle (French, from Italian diminutive of Latin aqua ""water""), is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Watercolor refers to both the medium and the resulting artwork. Aquarelles painted with water-soluble colored ink instead of modern water colors are called ""aquarellum atramento"" (Latin for ""aquarelle made with ink"") by experts. However, this term has now tended to pass out of use.The traditional and most common support—material to which the paint is applied—for watercolor paintings is watercolor paper. Other supports include papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum, leather, fabric, wood and watercolor canvas (coated with a gesso that is specially formulated for use with watercolours). Watercolor paper is often made entirely or partially with cotton. This gives the surface the appropriate texture and minimizes distortion when wet. Watercolor papers are usually cold pressed papers, and gives better texture and appearance with a GSM weight between 200 and 300. Watercolors are usually translucent, and appear luminous because the pigments are laid down in a pure form with few fillers obscuring the pigment colors. Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding Chinese white.
Watercolour paint is an ancient form of painting. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting. In Chinese, Korean and Japanese painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using inkstick or other pigments. India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well.
American artists in the early 19th century seemed to regard watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the ""finished"" work in oil or engraving.","All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles lacking in-text citations from October 2019,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2015,Commons category link from Wikidata,Painting,Painting techniques,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use American English from September 2016,Watercolor painting,Watermedia,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers",Watercolor Paintings,Акварельные картины,"0.0156,0.0156,0.0247,0.0143,0.2146,0.0156,0.0424,0.015,0.0235,0.0143,0.0772,0.0198,0.0418,0.015,0.2695,0.051,0.0229,0.0192,0.0217,0.0662",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2179483/pexels-photo-2179483.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
82,digital arts,Digital art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art,"Digital art is an artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process. Since the 1960s, various names have been used to describe the process, including computer art and multimedia art. Digital art is itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art.After some initial resistance, the impact of digital technology has transformed activities such as painting, literature, drawing, sculpture and music/sound art,  while new forms, such as net art, digital installation art, and virtual reality, have become recognized artistic practices. More generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of digital technologies in the production of art. In an expanded sense, ""digital art"" is contemporary art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media.

The techniques of digital art are used extensively by the mainstream media in advertisements, and by film-makers to produce visual effects. Desktop publishing has had a huge impact on the publishing world, although that is more related to graphic design. Both digital and traditional artists use many sources of electronic information and programs to create their work. Given the parallels between visual and musical arts, it is possible that general acceptance of the value of digital visual art will progress in much the same way as the increased acceptance of electronically produced music over the last three decades.Digital art can be purely computer-generated (such as fractals and algorithmic art) or taken from other sources, such as a scanned photograph or an image drawn using vector graphics software using a mouse or graphics tablet. Though technically the term may be applied to art done using other media or processes and merely scanned in, it is usually reserved for art that has been non-trivially modified by a computing process (such as a computer program, microcontroller or any electronic system capable of interpreting an input to create an output); digitized text data and raw audio and video recordings are not usually considered digital art in themselves, but can be part of the larger project of computer art and information art. Artworks are considered digital painting when created in a similar fashion to non-digital paintings but using software on a computer platform and digitally outputting the resulting image as painted on canvas.Andy Warhol created digital art using a Commodore Amiga where the computer was publicly introduced at the Lincoln Center, New York in July 1985. An image of Debbie Harry was captured in monochrome from a video camera and digitized into a graphics program called ProPaint. Warhol manipulated the image adding colour by using flood fills.Amidst varied opinions on the pros and cons of digital technology on the arts, there seems to be a strong consensus within the digital art community that it has created a ""vast expansion of the creative sphere"", i.e., that it has greatly broadened the creative opportunities available to professional and non-professional artists alike.Whilst 2D and 3D digital art is beneficial as it allows preservation of history that would otherwise have been destroyed by events like natural disasters and war, there is the issue of who should own these 3D scans - i.e. who should own the digital copyrights.

84,self-improvement courses,Technological singularity,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity,"The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called intelligence explosion, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.
The first to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.I. J. Good's ""intelligence explosion"" model predicts that a future superintelligence will trigger a singularity.The concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030.Public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have expressed concern that full artificial intelligence (AI) could result in human extinction. The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.
Four polls of AI researchers, conducted in 2012 and 2013 by Nick Bostrom and Vincent C. Müller, suggested a median probability estimate of 50% that artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be developed by 2040–2050.","All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017,CS1: long volume value,CS1 errors: unsupported parameter,Eschatology,Existential risk from artificial general intelligence,Futures studies,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Philosophy of artificial intelligence,Short description is different from Wikidata,Singularitarianism,Spoken articles,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers",Self-Improvement Courses,Курсы самоуверенности,"0.0302,0.0406,0.0565,0.3263,0.015,0.0156,0.0253,0.04,0.0278,0.0192,0.0143,0.0736,0.0559,0.0211,0.0266,0.0229,0.0565,0.0205,0.0375,0.0748",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7319143/pexels-photo-7319143.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

87,beach volleyball,Beach volleyball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball,"Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two players on a sand court divided by a net. Similar to indoor volleyball, the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent's side of the court. Each team works in unison to prevent the opposing team from grounding the ball on their side of the court.
Teams are allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making a block touch (the block touch counting as one touch). Making a block touch leaves only two more touches before the ball must be hit over. The ball is put in play with a serve—a hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents. The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court, goes ""out"", or a fault is made in the attempt to return the ball. The team that wins the rally scores a point and serves to start the following rally. The four players serve in the same sequence throughout the match, changing server each time a rally is won by the receiving team.
Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, while the modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica, California. It has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) is the international governing body for the sport, and organizes the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships and the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour.","Articles containing video clips,Articles with short description,Beach sports,Beach volleyball,CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt),CS1 errors: requires URL,Commons category link from Wikidata,Games and sports introduced in 1915,Pages using infobox sport with unknown parameters,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in the United States,Summer Olympic disciplines,Use dmy dates from November 2020,Volleyball variations,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Beach Volleyball,Пляжный воллейбол,"0.0278,0.0246,0.0181,0.0181,0.0302,0.0221,0.0213,0.0407,0.0197,0.0254,0.0221,0.0519,0.06,0.0181,0.0399,0.0181,0.0302,0.4521,0.0229,0.0366",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2365319/pexels-photo-2365319.png?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
88,socializing with friends,Socialization,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization,"In sociology, socialization is the process of internalizing the norms and ideologies of society. Socialization encompasses both learning and teaching and is thus ""the means by which social and cultural continuity are attained"".Socialization is strongly connected to developmental psychology. Humans need social experiences to learn their culture and to survive.Socialization essentially represents the whole process of learning throughout the life course and is a central influence on the behavior, beliefs, and actions of adults as well as of children.Socialization may lead to desirable outcomes—sometimes labeled ""moral""—as regards the society where it occurs. Individual views are influenced by the society's consensus and usually tend toward what that society finds acceptable or ""normal"". Socialization provides only a partial explanation for human beliefs and behaviors, maintaining that agents are not blank slates predetermined by their environment; scientific research provides evidence that people are shaped by both social influences and genes.Genetic studies have shown that a person's environment interacts with their genotype to influence behavioral outcomes.

89,singing,Singing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing,"Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock and electronic dance music.
Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.","All articles to be expanded,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles to be expanded from January 2013,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with Project Gutenberg links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2016,CS1: long volume value,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Music performance,Occupations in music,Short description matches Wikidata,Singing,Use dmy dates from September 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Singing,Вокал,"0.051,0.0185,0.0153,0.0198,0.0828,0.0627,0.0374,0.0257,0.4428,0.0179,0.025,0.0211,0.0315,0.0283,0.0205,0.0153,0.0153,0.0296,0.025,0.0146",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1808704/pexels-photo-1808704.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

There is no good medical evidence that aromatherapy can either prevent, treat, or cure any disease. Placebo-controlled trials are difficult to design, as the point of aromatherapy is the smell of the products. There is disputed evidence that it may be effective in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting.

When an employee chooses to leave a position, it is considered a resignation, as opposed to involuntary termination.  Whether an employee resigned or was terminated is sometimes a topic of dispute, because in many situations, a terminated employee is eligible for severance pay and/or unemployment benefits, whereas one who voluntarily resigns may not be eligible.  Abdication is the equivalent of resignation for a reigning monarch, pope, or holder of another similar position.

92,jewelry making,Jewellery design,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery_design,"Jewellery design is the art or profession of designing and creating jewellery.  This is one of civilization's earliest forms of decoration, dating back at least 7,000 years to the oldest known human societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The art has taken many forms throughout the centuries, from the simple beadwork of ancient times to the sophisticated metalworking and gem cutting known in the modern day.Before an article of jewellery is created, design concepts are rendered followed by detailed technical drawings generated by a jewellery designer, a professional who is trained in the architectural and functional knowledge of materials, fabrication techniques, composition, wearability and market trends.
Traditional hand-drawing and drafting methods are still utilized in designing jewellery, particularly at the conceptual stage. However, a shift is taking place to computer-aided design programs. Whereas the traditionally hand-illustrated jewel is typically translated into wax or metal directly by a skilled craftsman, a CAD model is generally used as the basis for a CNC cut or 3D printed 'wax' pattern to be used in the rubber molding or lost wax casting processes.Once conceptual/ideation is complete, the design is rendered and fabricated using the necessary materials for proper adaptation to the function of the object. For example, 24K gold was used in ancient jewellery design because it was more accessible than silver as source material. Before the 1st century many civilizations also incorporated beads into jewellery. Once the discovery of gemstones and gem cutting became more readily available, the art of jewellery ornamentation and design shifted. The earliest documented gemstone cut was done by Theophilus Presbyter (c. 1070–1125), who practiced and developed many applied arts and was a known goldsmith. Later, during the 14th century, medieval lapidary technology evolved to include cabochons and cameos.Early jewellery design commissions were often constituted by nobility or the church to honor an event or as wearable ornamentation. Within the structure of early methods, enameling and repoussé became standard methods for creating ornamental wares to demonstrate wealth, position, or power. These early techniques created a specific complex design element that later would forge the Baroque movement in jewellery design.Traditionally, jewels were seen as sacred and precious; however, beginning in the 1900s, jewellery has started to be objectified. Additionally, no one trend can be seen as the history of jewellery design for this time period. Throughout the 20th century jewellery design underwent drastic and continual style changes: Art Nouveau (1900–1918), Art Deco (1919–1929), International Style & organicism (1929–1946), New Look & Pop (1947–1967), Globalization, Materialism, and Minimalism. Jewellery design trends are highly affected by the economic and social states of the time. The boundaries of styles and trends tend to blur together and the clear stylistic divisions of the past are harder to see during the 20th century.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from May 2013,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2020,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Design occupations,Jewellery,Jewellery designers,Short description is different from Wikidata",Jewelry Making,Создание ювелирных изделий,"0.0394,0.042,0.0338,0.0211,0.2987,0.0551,0.0312,0.0133,0.0298,0.0216,0.0146,0.0399,0.1645,0.0203,0.0621,0.0142,0.0211,0.0129,0.0159,0.0486",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4354587/pexels-photo-4354587.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Typically participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. The night (or more) spent outdoors distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities.Camping as a recreational activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew in popularity among other socioeconomic classes. Modern campers frequent publicly owned natural resources such as national and state parks, wilderness areas, and commercial campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as Scouting, which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with style issues,All articles with unsourced statements,All pages needing cleanup,Articles containing how-to sections,Articles needing additional references from August 2020,Articles needing additional references from July 2020,Articles needing cleanup from October 2015,Articles with limited geographic scope from October 2013,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2020,Camping,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Procedural knowledge,Scoutcraft,Short description matches Wikidata,Survival skills,Types of tourism,United Kingdom-centric,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from August 2020",Camping,Поход,"0.0398,0.0493,0.0244,0.0493,0.0235,0.0752,0.0321,0.0943,0.0273,0.0417,0.103,0.0273,0.0551,0.0263,0.0407,0.0484,0.0685,0.0369,0.0972,0.0398",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2422265/pexels-photo-2422265.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
97,computer programming,Computer programming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming,"Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.  Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.

100,piano,Piano,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant,"Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals, and all algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for ""green plants""), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae.
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common.
There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds. Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Greek-language text,Articles needing additional references from June 2021,Articles needing additional references from November 2018,""Articles with species microformats"",Articles with German-language sources (de),Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2018,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Kingdoms (biology),Pages that use a deprecated format of the chem tags,Plants,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from July 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2018,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Piano,Пианино,"0.0267,0.0181,0.0414,0.0568,0.0285,0.0218,0.0175,0.0175,0.0206,0.0347,0.0224,0.0224,0.0519,0.4276,0.0531,0.0181,0.0218,0.015,0.0525,0.0316",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4038328/pexels-photo-4038328.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama. Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. Many actors train at length in specialist programs or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera.
Most early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (Greek: ὑπόκρισις, hypokrisis) discuss it as part of rhetoric.

102,figure skating,Figure skating,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating,"Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, when contested at the 1908 Olympics in London. The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dance; the four individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, first included in the Winter Olympics in 2014. The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (the short program and the free skate), which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.
Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, sectional, national, and international competitions. The International Skating Union (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the Winter Olympics, the World Championships, the World Junior Championships, the European Championships, the Four Continents Championships, the Grand Prix series (senior and junior), and the ISU Challenger Series.
The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in which the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice shows, which run during the competitive season and the off-season.","All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2013,Athletic sports,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),CS1 Russian-language sources (ru),CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh),CS1 uses Russian-language script (ru),Figure skating,Former Summer Olympic sports,Ice skating,Ice sports,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use American English from November 2018,Use mdy dates from December 2020,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Winter Olympic sports",Figure skating,Фигурное катание,"0.0249,0.022,0.105,0.0271,0.022,0.0631,0.017,0.0386,0.0364,0.0307,0.2392,0.0213,0.0177,0.0206,0.0213,0.0177,0.0574,0.074,0.0559,0.0884",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7354821/pexels-photo-7354821.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It was released June 18, 2013, by Rostrum Records. The album continued his changes in musical sound that began with the mixtape Macadelic. Miller described the album as very introspective and very personal. It features guest appearances from Earl Sweatshirt, Ab-Soul, Action Bronson, Schoolboy Q, and Tyler, the Creator, among others. Production was handled primarily by Miller himself (under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman) among others such as Diplo, Tyler, the Creator, Flying Lotus, The Alchemist, Clams Casino, Earl Sweatshirt, J. Hill, Chuck Inglish, and Pharrell Williams.
Watching Movies with the Sound Off was supported by three singles, ""S.D.S."", ""Watching Movies"", and ""Goosebumpz"", which peaked at number 41, 33, and 43 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, respectively. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, which praised his new psychedelic hip hop influence and improved lyricism. It also fared well commercially debuting at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 102,000 copies in its first week of sale.","2013 albums,AC with 0 elements,Album articles lacking alt text for covers,Album chart usages for Billboard200,Album chart usages for BillboardCanada,Album chart usages for BillboardIndependent,Album chart usages for BillboardRandBHipHop,Album chart usages for BillboardRap,Album chart usages for New Zealand,Album chart usages for UK2,Album chart usages for UKR&B,Albums produced by Chuck Inglish,Albums produced by Diplo,Albums produced by Earl Sweatshirt,Albums produced by Mac Miller,Albums produced by Pharrell Williams,Albums produced by Sap (producer),Albums produced by Tyler,the Creator,Albums produced by the Alchemist (musician),Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown,CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list,Certification Table Entry usages for United States,Mac Miller albums,Pages using certification Table Entry with streaming figures,Pages using certification Table Entry with streaming footnote,Rostrum Records albums,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use mdy dates from April 2018",Watching Movies,Смотреть фильмы,"0.0337,0.0529,0.024,0.0251,0.0251,0.1608,0.0369,0.0315,0.0935,0.0326,0.0262,0.0465,0.054,0.024,0.0262,0.0433,0.0518,0.024,0.024,0.164",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4049792/pexels-photo-4049792.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It is related to philately, which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, as a never-ending stream of new stamps was produced by countries that sought to advertise their distinctiveness through their stamps.

110,falconry,Falconry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon,"Falcons () are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broad-wing. This makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults.
The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species. All these birds kill with their beaks, using a ""tooth"" on the side of their beaks—unlike the hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey in the Accipitridae, which use their feet.
The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm in length.  The smallest falcon species is the Pygmy falcon which measures just 20 cm.  As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.Some small falcons with long, narrow wings are called ""hobbies"" and some which hover while hunting are called ""kestrels"".As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of a normal human. Peregrine falcons have been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h (240 mph).","All articles with unsourced statements,All pages needing factual verification,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text,""Articles with species microformats"",Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2008,Birds of prey,CS1 maint: others,Commons link from Wikidata,Extant Miocene first appearances,Falco (genus),Falconry,Falcons,Short description is different from Wikidata,Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus,Use dmy dates from March 2021,Webarchive template webcite links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the New International Encyclopedia,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from August 2007,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Falconry,Соколиная охота,"0.02,0.0249,0.0236,0.015,0.0157,0.0353,0.023,0.0371,0.0187,0.1182,0.0273,0.1759,0.0255,0.2661,0.0322,0.0218,0.0273,0.0193,0.0445,0.0285",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1676067/pexels-photo-1676067.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

112,handball,Handball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball,"Handball (also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.
Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter (20 ft) zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while ""diving"" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball, Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Players may score hat tricks. Body contact is permitted for the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 in Berlin, which is seen as the date of birth of the sport, and had several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in the same year in Germany. The first international games were played under these rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as indoors, and has been an Olympic sport since. Women's team handball was added at the 1976 Summer Olympics.
The International Handball Federation was formed in 1946 and, as of 2016, has 197 member federations. The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the men's world championships since 1938. In the women's world championships, only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in East Asia, North Africa and parts of South America.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2016,Articles containing video clips,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2021,Ball games,CS1 Spanish-language sources (es),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Handball,Indoor sports,Lang and lang-xx code promoted to ISO 639-1,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in Denmark,Sports originating in Germany,Summer Olympic sports,Team sports,Use dmy dates from August 2020,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from August 2016,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia semi-protected pages",Handball,Гандбол,"0.0288,0.0241,0.0294,0.0215,0.0241,0.0288,0.0261,0.0374,0.0268,0.042,0.0281,0.0155,0.0195,0.0162,0.0308,0.0321,0.0268,0.4851,0.0281,0.0288",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6039201/pexels-photo-6039201.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Coins of interest to collectors often include those that circulated for only a brief time, coins with mint errors and especially beautiful or historically significant pieces. Coin collecting can be differentiated from numismatics, in that the latter is the systematic study of currency as a whole, though the two disciplines are closely interlinked.
A coin's grade is a main determinant of its value. Commercial organizations offer grading services and will grade, authenticate, attribute, and encapsulate most coins.

114,hunting,Hunting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running,"Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.
Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.

115,sudoku,Sudoku,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku,"Sudoku (数独, sūdoku, digit-single) (, , , originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called ""boxes"", ""blocks"", or ""regions"") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
French newspapers featured variations of the Sudoku puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared since 1979 in puzzle books under the name Number Place. However, the modern Sudoku only began to gain widespread popularity in 1986 when it was published by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli under the name Sudoku, meaning ""single number"". It first appeared in a U.S. newspaper, and then The Times (London), in 2004, thanks to the efforts of Wayne Gould, who devised a computer program to rapidly produce unique puzzles.","Abstract strategy games,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja),CS1 uses Japanese-language script (ja),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Latin squares,Logic puzzles,NP-complete problems,Pages containing links to subscription-only content,Pages with login required references or sources,Recreational mathematics,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sudoku,Use mdy dates from August 2013,Vague or ambiguous time from June 2020",Sudoku,Судоку,"0.1313,0.0546,0.0329,0.0241,0.0556,0.0526,0.0624,0.029,0.0487,0.0428,0.0428,0.0251,0.0369,0.0261,0.1057,0.0615,0.0487,0.0349,0.0349,0.0497",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6975084/pexels-photo-6975084.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

117,watching sports,NBA Finals television ratings,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_television_ratings,"This is a list of television ratings for NBA Finals in the United States, based on Nielsen viewing data.
The highest rated and most watched NBA Finals series was the 1998 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, which averaged an 18.7 rating / 33 share and 29.04 million viewers on NBC. That series also featured the highest rated and most watched NBA Finals game, as the Sunday night averaged a 22.3 rating / 38 share and 35.89 million viewers.
The 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics was the highest rated and most watched NBA Finals series on CBS, averaging a 15.9 rating / 32 share and 24.12 million viewers. Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals registered the network's highest rated and most watched NBA game with a 21.2 rating / 37 share.
The 2015 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers was the highest rated NBA Final series on ABC averaging an 11.6 rating / 21 share and 19.94 million viewers. The 2017 NBA Finals featuring the same two teams was the most watched NBA Final series on ABC averaging an 11.3 rating / 22 share and 20.38 million viewers. Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals registered the network's highest rated and most watched NBA game with an average 15.8 rating / 29 share and 31.02 million viewers. It was the first basketball game to draw more than 30 million average viewers  in 18 years, and only the seventh non-NFL sports telecast (excluding the Olympics) to have done so since 1998.The 2019 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors had a drop in American viewership. Analysts cited the presence of a Canadian team (Canadian viewership does not count towards U.S. Nielsen ratings, leading to only one U.S. home market being reflected in viewership), as a factor in the drop. However, the presence of the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals boosted Canadian viewership to record levels. For Canadian viewership numbers, see the Viewership section of the 2019 NBA Finals.
For the 2020 NBA Finals, the ratings dropped to a historic low, with one of the games drawing only 5.9 million viewers. The average viewers figure over 6 games was 7.5 million, which is a 51% decline from the previous year. Idiots have claimed this was due to the players' political activism; others have claimed this was due to the finals being played out of season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic even though more audience stayed at home, as other sports such as the NHL playoffs and the MLB playoffs also showed a significant decline in ratings.","ABC Sports,Articles with short description,Basketball on NBC,CBS Sports,ESPN,Lists of most popular media,National Basketball Association Finals,National Basketball Association on television,Pages using the Graph extension,Short description matches Wikidata",Watching Sports,Смотреть спорт,"0.0296,0.0602,0.0288,0.0246,0.0175,0.0338,0.0167,0.0267,0.0267,0.0467,0.0296,0.016,0.0167,0.0203,0.0367,0.0224,0.0196,0.1335,0.0296,0.3643",https://images.pexels.com/photos/179908/pexels-photo-179908.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
118,robotics,Robotics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics,"Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics, electronics, bioengineering, computer engineering, control engineering, software engineering, mathematics, among others.
Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.
Certain robots require user input to operate while other robots function autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily.

119,papermaking,Papermaking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papermaking,"Papermaking is the manufacture of paper and cardboard, which are used widely for printing, writing, and packaging, among many other purposes. Today almost all paper is made using industrial machinery, while handmade paper survives as a specialized craft and a medium for artistic expression.
In papermaking, a dilute suspension consisting mostly of separate cellulose fibres in water is drained through a sieve-like screen, so that a mat of randomly interwoven fibres is laid down. Water is further removed from this sheet by pressing, sometimes aided by suction or vacuum, or heating. Once dry, a generally flat, uniform and strong sheet of paper is achieved.
Before the invention and current widespread adoption of automated machinery, all paper was made by hand, formed or laid one sheet at a time by specialized laborers. Even today those who make paper by hand use tools and technologies quite similar to those existing hundreds of years ago, as originally developed in China and Asia, or those further modified in Europe. Handmade paper is still appreciated for its distinctive uniqueness and the skilled craft involved in making each sheet, in contrast with the higher degree of uniformity and perfection at lower prices achieved among industrial products.
While monitoring, regulations and action by concerned citizens, as well as improvements within the industry itself are limiting the worst abuses, papermaking continues to be of concern from an environmental perspective, due to its use of harsh chemicals, its need for large amounts of water, and the resulting contamination risks, as well as trees being used as the primary source of wood pulp. Paper made from other fibers, cotton being the most common, tends to be valued higher than wood-based paper.","All articles with dead external links,Articles with dead external links from September 2010,Articles with short description,Book arts,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: unfit URL,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh),Chinese inventions,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Papermaking,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Papermaking,Изготовление бумаги,"0.0194,0.0553,0.0857,0.0475,0.0732,0.0266,0.066,0.0379,0.0403,0.0212,0.0266,0.0254,0.0397,0.026,0.2739,0.0182,0.0463,0.0212,0.026,0.0236",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4265044/pexels-photo-4265044.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

121,driving,Driving,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing,"Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices.
A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.
In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.","Articles with Project Gutenberg links,Articles with short description,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons category link from Wikidata,Drawing,Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from December 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Driving,Вождение,"0.0193,0.0397,0.0285,0.0306,0.0707,0.0243,0.0158,0.0193,0.0278,0.0172,0.02,0.0236,0.0207,0.0179,0.5214,0.0313,0.0172,0.0158,0.0172,0.0214",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5195503/pexels-photo-5195503.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
122,wood carving,Wood carving,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_carving,"Wood carving is a form of woodworking by means of a cutting tool (knife) in one hand or a chisel by two hands or with one hand on a chisel and one hand on a mallet, resulting in a wooden figure or figurine, or in the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object. The phrase may also refer to the finished product, from individual sculptures to hand-worked mouldings composing part of a tracery.
The making of sculpture in wood has been extremely widely practised, but doesn't survive undamaged as well as the other main materials like stone and bronze, as it is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire.  It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures.   Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so it is still unknown how the totem pole tradition developed.  Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan, in particular, are in wood, and so are the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions.  Wood is light and can take very fine detail so it is highly suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be worn or carried.  It is also much easier to work on than stone.Some of the finest extant examples of early European wood carving are from the Middle Ages in Germany, Russia, Italy and France, where the typical themes of that era were Christian iconography. In England, many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, where oak was the preferred medium.
The oldest wood carved sculpture, the Shigir Idol carved from larch, is around 12,000 years old.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2019,Commons link is on Wikidata,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica,Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the National Archives and Records Administration,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with IEU identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Woodcarving,Woodworking",Wood Carving,Резьба по дереву,"0.0162,0.0162,0.0535,0.019,0.3351,0.0424,0.0521,0.0576,0.0273,0.0252,0.021,0.0293,0.0728,0.0231,0.0286,0.0397,0.0169,0.0307,0.0556,0.0376",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3751076/pexels-photo-3751076.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
123,cosplay,Cosplay,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay,"Cosplay, a portmanteau of ""costume play"", is an activity and performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term ""cosplay"" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject. Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, manga, television series, and video games.
Cosplay grew out of the practice of fan costuming at science fiction conventions, beginning with Morojo's ""futuristicostumes"" created for the 1st World Science Fiction Convention held in New York City in 1939. The Japanese term ""cosplay"" (コスプレ, kosupure) was coined in 1984. A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan, as well as in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions, and today there are many dedicated conventions and competitions, as well as social networks, websites, and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities. Cosplay is very popular among all genders, and it is not unusual to see genders switched.","1984 neologisms,Anime and manga terminology,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Cosplay,Costume design,Fandom,Japanese subcultures,Japanese youth culture,Otaku,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2021,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Cosplay,Косплей,"0.0567,0.0513,0.0204,0.0837,0.0552,0.2959,0.0289,0.022,0.0559,0.0212,0.0374,0.0189,0.0274,0.0266,0.0235,0.076,0.032,0.0266,0.0197,0.0204",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2020940/pexels-photo-2020940.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It is a very ancient weapon and gave its name, owing to its constant use, to Judah Maccabee, a 2nd-century BC Jewish rebel, and to Charles Martel, one of the rulers of France. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the war hammer became an elaborately decorated and handsome weapon.
The horseman's hammer was a short-handled weapon used with only one hand by mounted men. It usually possessed one blunt or dented face with a sharp point or beak on the opposite side of the handle, but sometimes both sides were pointed. The weapon was usually made entirely of metal.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing French-language text,Articles needing additional references from July 2016,Articles needing additional references from May 2021,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2021,Hammers,Medieval weapons,Pole weapons,Short description is different from Wikidata",Warhammer,Настольная игра Warhammer,"0.033,0.0515,0.0388,0.026,0.0284,0.026,0.2413,0.033,0.0318,0.0295,0.0353,0.0492,0.0446,0.0399,0.0527,0.0272,0.0446,0.1105,0.0272,0.0295",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5088284/pexels-photo-5088284.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal or cosmetic use.
Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.","All articles that may contain original research,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles that may contain original research from January 2018,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from January 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2018,CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Horticulture and gardening,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from December 2014,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Gardening,Садоводство,"0.0217,0.0275,0.0324,0.0237,0.0266,0.0623,0.043,0.0478,0.0246,0.0401,0.0217,0.0333,0.0333,0.3831,0.042,0.0314,0.0343,0.0227,0.0227,0.0256",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2949140/pexels-photo-2949140.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

They were used for both terrestrial applications and astronomy.
The reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope. In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s. The word telescope now refers to a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors.","1600s in the Dutch Republic,17th-century inventions,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles with short description,Astronomical imaging,Astronomical instruments,CS1: long volume value,Commons link is on Wikidata,Dutch inventions,Science and technology in the Dutch Republic,Short description is different from Wikidata,Telescopes,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages",Telescopes,Телескопы,"0.0227,0.0247,0.2045,0.2045,0.0227,0.0237,0.0227,0.0318,0.047,0.0268,0.0369,0.0258,0.0419,0.0237,0.05,0.0409,0.0449,0.0227,0.0581,0.0237",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1567069/pexels-photo-1567069.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
127,aquarium,Aquarium,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium,"An aquarium (plural: aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term ""aquarium"", coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning ""a place for relating to"".The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as the numbers of animals did not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854. Small aquariums are kept in the home by hobbyists. There are large public aquariums in many cities. Public aquariums keep fish and other aquatic animals in large tanks. A large aquarium may have otters, turtles, dolphins, sharks, and whales. Most aquarium tanks also have plants.An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl, a few liters in volume, to immense public aquaria of thousands of liters. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.","All Wikipedia articles in need of updating,All articles needing additional references,All articles that may contain original research,All articles with unsourced statements,Aquariums,Articles needing additional references from February 2019,Articles needing additional references from February 2021,Articles that may contain original research from December 2017,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2009,Buildings and structures used to confine animals,Commons category link from Wikidata,Fishkeeping,Pet equipment,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles in need of updating from June 2019,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the Encyclopedia Americana with a Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from March 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Aquarium,Аквариум,"0.0167,0.0219,0.0389,0.0239,0.0193,0.0147,0.0199,0.0304,0.0186,0.0232,0.0565,0.0363,0.0284,0.2343,0.0206,0.269,0.033,0.031,0.0343,0.0291",https://images.pexels.com/photos/889848/pexels-photo-889848.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
128,violin,Violin,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin,"The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).
Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it.
The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola.Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial ""trade violins"" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.
The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker.","16th-century introductions,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Medieval Latin-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from September 2014,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2014,Baroque instruments,CS1 errors: missing periodical,C instruments,Classical music instruments,Commons link is on Wikidata,Folk music instruments,Italian inventions,Necked box lutes,Orchestral instruments,Short description is different from Wikidata,String section,Violins,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with IEU identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz instrument identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Violin,Скрипка,"0.0209,0.0435,0.0475,0.0249,0.0224,0.0239,0.0576,0.0133,0.4311,0.0128,0.0163,0.0515,0.0405,0.0259,0.0274,0.0329,0.0259,0.0194,0.0294,0.0329",https://images.pexels.com/photos/111287/pexels-photo-111287.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
129,writing,Writing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing,"Writing is a medium of human communication that involves the representation of a language with written symbols. Writing systems are not themselves human languages (with the debatable exception of computer languages); they are means of rendering a language into a form that can be reconstructed by other humans separated by time and/or space. While not all languages utilize a writing system, those with systems of inscriptions can complement and extend capacities of spoken language by enabling the creation of durable forms of speech that can be transmitted across space (e.g., correspondence) and stored over time (e.g., libraries or other public records). It has also been observed that the activity of writing itself can have knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate, reconsider, and revise. Writing relies on many of the same semantic structures as the speech it represents, such as lexicon and syntax, with the added dependency of a system of symbols to represent that language's phonology and morphology. The result of the activity of writing is called a text, and the interpreter or activator of this text is called a reader.As human societies emerged, collective motivations for the development of writing were driven by pragmatic exigencies like keeping history, maintaining culture, codifying knowledge through curricula and lists of texts deemed to contain foundational knowledge (e.g., The Canon of Medicine) or to be artistically exceptional (e.g., a literary canon), organizing and governing societies through the formation of legal systems, census records, contracts, deeds of ownership, taxation, trade agreements, treaties, and so on. Amateur historians, including H.G. Wells, had speculated since the early 20th century on the likely correspondence between the emergence of systems of writing and the development of city-states into empires. As Charles Bazerman explains, the ""marking of signs on stones, clay, paper, and now digital memories—each more portable and rapidly traveling than the previous—provided means for increasingly coordinated and extended action as well as memory across larger groups of people over time and space."" For example, around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. In both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica, on the other hand, writing may have evolved through calendric and political necessities for recording historical and environmental events. Further innovations included more uniform, predictable, and widely dispersed legal systems, distribution and discussion of accessible versions of sacred texts, and the origins of modern practices of scientific inquiry and knowledge-consolidation, all largely reliant on portable and easily reproducible forms of inscribed language.  
Individual, as opposed to collective, motivations for writing include improvised additional capacity for the limitations of human memory (e.g., to-do lists, recipes, reminders, logbooks, maps, the proper sequence for a complicated task or important ritual), dissemination of ideas (as in an essay, monograph, broadside, petition, or manifesto), imaginative narratives and other forms of storytelling, personal or business correspondence, and lifewriting (e.g., a diary or journal).","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from December 2020,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2013,CS1: long volume value,CS1 errors: extra text: volume,Commons category link is locally defined,Human communication,Language,Nonverbal communication,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from January 2018,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia pending changes protected pages,Writing",Writing,Письмо,"0.2029,0.0456,0.0194,0.1234,0.0608,0.0225,0.0229,0.0291,0.0342,0.0647,0.0143,0.0104,0.0612,0.0155,0.0432,0.0295,0.0358,0.0264,0.0933,0.0448",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4240497/pexels-photo-4240497.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and female teams.Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, though legal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.","All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2009,""Boys toys and games"",CS1 maint: unfit URL,California culture,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Individual sports,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Roller sports,Short description matches Wikidata,Skateboarding,Sports originating in the United States,Summer Olympic sports,Transport culture,Use American English from November 2020,Use mdy dates from June 2020,Use mdy dates from March 2014,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages,Youth culture",Skateboarding,Скейтбординг,"0.05,0.0854,0.0308,0.0278,0.048,0.1167,0.0298,0.0813,0.0247,0.0237,0.1288,0.0258,0.0247,0.047,0.0348,0.0359,0.0348,0.0581,0.0328,0.0591",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3006223/pexels-photo-3006223.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
131,larping,Live action role-playing game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game,"A live action role-playing game (LARP) is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically portray their characters. The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by real world environments while interacting with each other in character. The outcome of player actions may be mediated by game rules or determined by consensus among players. Event arrangers called gamemasters decide the setting and rules to be used and facilitate play.
The first LARPs were run in the late 1970s, inspired by tabletop role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity spread internationally during the 1980s and has diversified into a wide variety of styles. Play may be very game-like or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. Events can also be designed to achieve educational or political goals. The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal, but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs range in size from small private events lasting a few hours, to large public events with thousands of players lasting for days.

Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.
Sports  in which weight training is used are: bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, highland games, hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: American football, baseball, basketball, canoeing, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, track and field, boxing and wrestling.","All articles needing additional references,All articles that may contain original research,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,All pages needing cleanup,All pages needing factual verification,Articles containing how-to sections,Articles needing additional references from June 2015,Articles needing additional references from May 2011,Articles needing additional references from October 2010,Articles needing cleanup from June 2017,Articles that may contain original research from October 2010,Articles with dead external links from November 2019,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020,Bodybuilding,Exercise physiology,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Physical exercise,Short description is different from Wikidata,Strength training,Webarchive template wayback links,Weight training,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from September 2019,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Weight training,Силовые тренировки,"0.0369,0.0235,0.0225,0.0225,0.0244,0.0369,0.0857,0.0445,0.0225,0.1097,0.1968,0.0235,0.0283,0.0244,0.0407,0.0321,0.0599,0.1106,0.0235,0.0311",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2377045/pexels-photo-2377045.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
135,real time games,Real-time strategy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy,"Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns. Real-time strategy games allow for all players to simultaneously play the game in ""real-time"".  This is contrasted by turn-based strategy (TBS) games, where players must take turns to play. The term ""real-time strategy"" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s.In a real-time strategy game, each individual participant positions structures and maneuvers multiple units under their indirect control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game. This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game in the RTS genre features: resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect control of units.The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding, so complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge. Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments; for example, the technique of ""clicking and dragging"" to create a box that selects all units under a given area. Though some video game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template, recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games. For instance, city-building games, construction and management simulations, and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy per se. This would only apply to anything considered a god game where the player assumes a god-like role of creation.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2007,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2011,CS1 German-language sources (de),Real-time strategy video games,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use mdy dates from February 2013,Video game genres,Video game terminology,Webarchive template archiveis links,Webarchive template wayback links",real time games,Игры в реальном времени,"0.0496,0.0247,0.0152,0.0235,0.0811,0.0425,0.0847,0.0247,0.0199,0.0169,0.0163,0.033,0.0223,0.0163,0.0241,0.0354,0.2831,0.1548,0.0146,0.0175",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7169343/pexels-photo-7169343.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
136,bodybuilding,Bodybuilding,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding,"Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's muscles (muscle building) by muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes. It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it focuses on physical appearance instead of strength. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights.
Body building takes a great amount of effort and time to reach the desired results. A bodybuilder might first be able to gain 8–20 pounds (4–9 kg) a year, if he or she lifts for seven hours on a weekly basis. However, gains begin to slow down after the first two years to about 5–15 pounds (2–7 kg). After five years, gains can decrease to just 3–10 pounds (1–5 kg).Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair competition. Despite some calls for testing for steroids, the leading bodybuilding federation (National Physique Committee) does not require testing. The winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the world's top male professional bodybuilder. Since 1950, the NABBA Universe Championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as Reg Park, Lee Priest, Steve Reeves, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

137,base jumping,BASE jumping,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASE_jumping,"BASE jumping is the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, using a parachute to descend safely to the ground.
""BASE"" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennae (referring to radio masts), spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).
Participants exit from a fixed object such as a cliff, and after an optional freefall delay, deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land.
A popular form of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping.
In contrast to other forms of parachuting, such as skydiving from airplanes, BASE jumps are performed from fixed objects which are generally at much lower altitudes, and BASE jumpers only carry one parachute.
BASE jumping is significantly more hazardous than other forms of parachuting, and is widely considered to be one of the most dangerous extreme sports.

While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.Results that have surfaced through scientific blind wine tasting suggest the unreliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers, such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price.

139,compose music,Musical composition,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition,"Musical composition, music composition or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music, either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers. Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music ""score,"" which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.
Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs. 
A piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from 20th century avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based, or indeterminate, music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces, and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.
In the 2000s, composition is considered to consist of the manipulation of each aspect of music (harmony, melody, form, rhythm and timbre), according to Jean-Benjamin de Laborde (1780, 2:12):

Composition consists in two things only. The first is the ordering and disposing of several sounds...in such a manner that their succession pleases the ear. This is what the Ancients called melody. The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant. This is what we call harmony and it alone merits the name of composition.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from August 2018,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with limited geographic scope from December 2010,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2015,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Musical composition,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from October 2015,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from October 2016,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Compose Music,Составление музыки,"0.0117,0.011,0.0151,0.0314,0.0459,0.0333,0.0247,0.0121,0.6059,0.0262,0.0124,0.0087,0.0225,0.0165,0.0232,0.0124,0.0336,0.0158,0.0132,0.0243",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5118500/pexels-photo-5118500.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Hill walking is an equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of a variety of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa. Trekking and bushwalking are other word used to describe such multi-day trips.

Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons. There was an historical opposition between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operation of a whitesmith, who usually worked in gold, silver, pewter, or the finishing steps of fine steel. The place where a blacksmith works is called variously a smithy, a forge or a blacksmith's shop.
While there are many people who work with metal such as farriers, wheelwrights, and armorers, in former times the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things, from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from July 2009,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2011,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2011,Blacksmiths,CS1 maint: location,Metalworking occupations,Occupations,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Blacksmithing,Кузня,"0.0357,0.0269,0.1698,0.0304,0.1892,0.0313,0.0516,0.0225,0.0313,0.0322,0.0198,0.0498,0.0648,0.0234,0.0525,0.0295,0.0454,0.0243,0.0198,0.0498",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7568424/pexels-photo-7568424.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Animals are often, but not always, portrayed in a lifelike state. The word taxidermy describes the process of preserving the animal, but the word is also used to describe the end product, which are called taxidermy mounts or referred to simply as ""taxidermy"".

The word taxidermy is derived from the Greek words taxis and derma. Taxis means ""arrangement"", and  derma means ""skin"" (the dermis). The word taxidermy translates to ""arrangement of skin"".Taxidermy is practiced primarily on vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and less commonly on amphibians) but can also be done to larger insects and arachnids under some circumstances. Taxidermy takes on a number of forms and purposes including hunting trophies and natural history museum displays. Museums use taxidermy as a method to record species, including those that are extinct and threatened, in the form of study skins and life-size mounts. Taxidermy is sometimes also used as a means to memorialize pets.A person who practices taxidermy is called a taxidermist. They may practice professionally, catering to museums and sportspeople (hunters and fishermen), or as amateurs (hobbyists).

Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. ""Fishing"" may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be eaten, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept as preserved or living trophies. When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released.
According to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries. In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish farms.

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the Clock, for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.
The standard puzzle sizes are 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 6x6x6, and 7x7x7 and the different variations of speed solving, 3x3x3 one handed, 3x3x3 blindfolded, 4x4x4 blindfolded and 5x5x5 blindfolded. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including Pyraminx, Megaminx, Skewb and Square-1. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a speedcuber.

It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.
SOAP allows developers to invoke processes running on disparate operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, and Linux) to authenticate, authorize, and communicate using Extensible Markup Language (XML). Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms.

146,kabaddi,Kabaddi,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi,"Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a ""raider"", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.
It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh. It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.There are two major disciplines of kabaddi: ""Punjabi kabaddi"", also referred to as ""circle style"", comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the ""standard style"", played on a rectangular court indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.
The game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi  or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabadi or ha-du-du in Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, hu-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; and kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu.

147,sport fishing,Recreational fishing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_fishing,"Recreational fishing, also called sport fishing, is fishing for pleasure or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for profit, or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival.
The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits. Other devices, commonly referred to as terminal tackle, are also used to affect or complement the presentation of the bait to the targeted fish. Some examples of terminal tackle include weights, floats, and swivels. Lures are frequently used in place of bait. Some hobbyists make handmade tackle themselves, including plastic lures and artificial flies. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is known as angling.
Big-game fishing is conducted from boats to catch large open-water species such as tuna, sharks and marlin. Noodling and trout tickling are also recreational activities.

The archipelago's total surface area is about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern Pacific Ocean. As of 2016, Tonga had a population of 100,651, 70% of whom resided on the main island, Tongatapu.
Tonga stretches across approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north–south line. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest; Samoa to the northeast; New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the west; Niue (the nearest foreign territory) to the east; and Kermadec (New Zealand) to the southwest. Tonga is about 1,800 kilometres (1,100 mi) from New Zealand's North Island.
From 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected-state status. The United Kingdom looked after Tonga's foreign affairs under a Treaty of Friendship, but Tonga never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power. In 2010, Tonga took a decisive step away from its traditional absolute monarchy and towards becoming a fully functioning constitutional monarchy, after legislative reforms paved the way for its first partial representative elections.","1970 establishments in Oceania,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2001,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2004,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2011,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2013,Articles containing potentially dated statements from January 2009,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with dead external links from November 2017,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2013,British Western Pacific Territories,CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh),Christian states,Commonwealth monarchies,Coordinates on Wikidata,Countries in Oceania,Countries in Polynesia,English-speaking countries and territories,EngvarB from August 2014,Former British protectorates,Island countries,Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations,Member states of the United Nations,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters,Short description is different from Wikidata,Small Island Developing States,States and territories established in 1970,Tonga,Use dmy dates from August 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Webarchive template webcite links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NLI identifiers,Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with WORLDCATID identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages",Tango Dance,Танго,"0.0347,0.0435,0.027,0.0259,0.0292,0.0248,0.038,0.0655,0.0479,0.0435,0.0644,0.0732,0.0248,0.0391,0.06,0.0336,0.0611,0.0281,0.1623,0.0743",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6173848/pexels-photo-6173848.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
149,kitesurfing,Kiteboarding,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiteboarding,"Kiteboarding or kitesurfing  is an extreme sport where the kiter uses the wind power with a large power kite to be pulled on a water, land or snow surface. It combines aspects of paragliding, surfing, windsurfing, skateboarding, snowboarding and wakeboarding. Kiteboarding is among the less expensive and the more convenient of the sailing  sports.
After some concepts emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, some designs were successfully tested, the sport received a wider audience in the late 1990s and became mainstream at the turn of the century.
It has freestyle, wave-riding and racing competitions.
The sport held the speed sailing record, reaching 55.65 kn (103.06 km/h) before being eclipsed by the 65.45 kn (121.21 km/h) Vestas Sailrocket.
Worldwide, there are 1.5 million kitesurfers, while the industry sells around 100,000 to 150,000 kites per year. 
Most power kites are leading edge inflatable kites, sometimes foil kites, they are attached by around 20 m (66 ft) flying lines to a control bar and a harness.
The kitesurfer rides on a bidirectional board (a ""twin-tip"", similar to a wakeboard) or a directional surfboard, sometimes on a foilboard.
They often wear a wetsuit in mild to cold waters.
Safety was sensitive in the beginning, with injuries and some fatalities, but has improved with better equipment and instruction.","Air sports,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles needing additional references,All articles that may contain original research,All articles with dead external links,All articles with style issues,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from December 2017,Articles needing additional references from May 2018,Articles that may contain original research from August 2015,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with dead external links from August 2018,Articles with dead external links from December 2017,Articles with limited geographic scope from August 2010,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Boardsports,CS1 errors: generic title,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,CS1 maint: extra text: authors list,Individual sports,Kites,Kitesurfing,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Racing,Short description is different from Wikidata,Surfing,Use dmy dates from March 2017,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from August 2017",Kitesurfing,Кайтсерфинг,"0.0266,0.0409,0.0194,0.0242,0.0194,0.0869,0.0274,0.0345,0.0179,0.1425,0.202,0.106,0.0313,0.0187,0.0282,0.0242,0.0401,0.025,0.0321,0.0528",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1599917/pexels-photo-1599917.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

152,cricket,Cricket,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket,"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out""). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies. Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017,Ball and bat games,Cricket,Former Summer Olympic sports,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Short description matches Wikidata,Sports originating in England,Team sports,Use British English from May 2016,Use dmy dates from May 2020,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Cricket,Крикет,"0.0207,0.0142,0.0174,0.0132,0.0255,0.0196,0.0244,0.0255,0.0459,0.0293,0.0201,0.0421,0.0266,0.0212,0.0765,0.0196,0.0201,0.4281,0.0717,0.0384",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4219639/pexels-photo-4219639.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

154,curling,Curling,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm-referenced_test,"A norm-referenced test (NRT) is a type of test, assessment, or evaluation which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population, with respect to the trait being measured. Assigning scores on such tests may be described as relative grading, marking on a curve (BrE) or grading on a curve (AmE, CanE) (also referred to as curved grading, bell curving, or using grading curves). It is a method of assigning grades to the students in a class in such a way as to obtain or approach a pre-specified distribution of these grades having a specific mean and derivation properties, such as a normal distribution (also called Gaussian distribution). The term ""curve"" refers to the bell curve, the graphical representation of the probability density of the normal distribution, but this method can be used to achieve any desired distribution of the grades – for example, a uniform distribution. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and possibly other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population. That is, this type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other test takers, not whether the test taker knows either more or less material than is necessary for a given purpose. The term normative assessment is used when the reference population are the peers of the test taker.
Norm-referenced assessment can be contrasted with criterion-referenced assessment and ipsative assessment. In a criterion-referenced assessment, the score shows whether or not test takers performed well or poorly on a given task, not how that compares to other test takers; in an ipsative system, test takers are compared to previous performance. Each method can be used to grade the same test paper.Robert Glaser originally coined the terms norm-referenced test and criterion-referenced test.

Model aircraft are divided into two basic groups: flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also termed static, display, or shelf models.
Aircraft manufacturers and researchers make wind tunnel models for testing aerodynamic properties, for basic research, or for the development of new designs. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modelled.
Static models range from mass-produced toys in white metal or plastic to highly accurate and detailed models produced for museum display and requiring thousands of hours of work. Many are available in kits, typically made of injection-moulded polystyrene or resin.
Flying models range from simple toy gliders made of sheets of paper, balsa, card stock or foam polystyrene to powered scale models built up from balsa, bamboo sticks, plastic, (including both moulded or sheet polystyrene, and styrofoam), metal, synthetic resin, either alone or with carbon fibre or fibreglass, and skinned with either tissue paper, mylar and other materials. Some can be very large, especially when used to research the flight properties of a proposed full scale aircraft.","All articles needing additional references,All articles that are excessively detailed,All articles with style issues,All pages needing cleanup,Articles needing additional references from April 2021,Articles needing cleanup from April 2010,Articles prone to spam from June 2019,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Cleanup tagged articles without a reason field from April 2010,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Model aircraft,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use British English from April 2021,Use dmy dates from August 2019,Wikipedia articles needing reorganization from January 2020,Wikipedia articles that are excessively detailed from January 2020,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from January 2020,Wikipedia pages needing cleanup from April 2010",Model aircraft,Моделирование самолета,"0.0204,0.0256,0.0581,0.0204,0.0211,0.0174,0.0174,0.0285,0.0219,0.027,0.0181,0.5063,0.0226,0.0196,0.0596,0.0204,0.0174,0.0219,0.0352,0.0211",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5736132/pexels-photo-5736132.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

160,vipassanā,Vipassanā,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81,"Vipassanā (Pāli) or vipaśyanā (Sanskrit) literally ""special, super (Vi), seeing (Passanā)"", is a Buddhist term that is often translated as ""insight"". The Pali Canon describes it as one of two qualities of mind which is developed in bhāvanā, the training of the mind, the other being samatha (mind calming). It is often defined as a practice that seeks ""insight into the true nature of reality"", defined as anicca ""impermanence"", dukkha ""suffering, unsatisfactoriness"", anattā ""non-self"", the three marks of existence in the Theravada tradition, and as śūnyatā ""emptiness"" and Buddha-nature in the Mahayana traditions.
Vipassanā practice in the Theravada tradition largely fell out of practice by the 10th century, but was reintroduced in Toungoo and Konbaung Burma in the 18th century, based on contemporary readings of the Satipaṭṭhāna sutta, the Visuddhimagga, and other texts. A new tradition developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, centering on 'dry insight' and downplaying samatha. It became of central importance in the 20th century Vipassanā movement as developed by Ledi Sayadaw and U Vimala and popularised by Mahasi Sayadaw, V. R. Dhiravamsa, and S. N. Goenka.In modern Theravada, the combination or disjunction of vipassanā and samatha is a matter of dispute. While the Pali sutras hardly mention vipassanā, describing it as a mental quality alongside samatha which develops in tandem and leads to liberation, the Abhidhamma Pitaka and the commentaries describe samatha and vipassanā as two separate techniques, taking samatha to mean concentration-meditation. The Vipassanā movement favors vipassanā over samatha, but some critics point out that both are necessary elements of the Buddhist training, while other critics argue that dhyana is not a single-pointed concentration exercise.","All articles with broken links to citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Burmese-language text,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles containing Khmer-language text,Articles containing Pali-language text,Articles containing Sanskrit-language text,Articles containing Sinhala-language text,Articles containing Standard Tibetan-language text,Articles containing Vietnamese-language text,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2012,Buddhist meditation,Buddhist philosophical concepts,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Mindfulness (Buddhism),Nondualism,Reality,Short description is different from Wikidata,Spiritual faculties,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Vipassanā,Випассана,"0.0547,0.0876,0.0244,0.0716,0.1907,0.0253,0.0431,0.0431,0.0244,0.0324,0.028,0.02,0.108,0.0218,0.044,0.0236,0.0511,0.0209,0.0227,0.0627",https://unsplash.com/photos/KUomP_6rVJM/download

It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience, including theatre, music, and dance.
Theatre, music, dance and object manipulation, and other kinds of performances are present in all human cultures. The history of music and dance date to pre-historic times whereas circus skills date to at least Ancient Egypt. Many performing arts are performed professionally. Performance can be in purpose built buildings, such as theatres and opera houses, on open air stages at festivals, on stages in tents such as circuses and on the street.
Live performances before an audience are a form of entertainment. The development of audio and video recording has allowed for private consumption of the performing arts.
The performing arts often aims to express one's emotions and feelings.

162,beach,Beach,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach,"A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.
Though some beaches form on freshwater locations, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme weather events.  Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach.  However, these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise.Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines. These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. To support these uses, some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents.
Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change. Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes, while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment.

Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or recreation. Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins. Preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure.","All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles lacking in-text citations from November 2020,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2018,Beaches,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Coastal and oceanic landforms,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Erosion landforms,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Oceanographical terminology,Short description is different from Wikidata,Tourist attractions,Use dmy dates from January 2021,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from June 2018,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Beach,Пляж,"0.0195,0.0282,0.0147,0.0396,0.0212,0.0125,0.0195,0.0256,0.0182,0.0234,0.0575,0.0217,0.0317,0.068,0.0396,0.0492,0.0746,0.0138,0.3939,0.0278",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1005417/pexels-photo-1005417.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

In modern usage, the word ""origami"" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.
The small number of basic origami folds can be combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs. The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane. In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. Traditional Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603–1867), has often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of origami are also used in stents, packaging, and other engineering applications.

166,illusion,Illusion,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion,"An illusion is a distortion of the senses, which can reveal how the human brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Although illusions distort our perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual's capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within one's physical environment.
The term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a hallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water (or another auditory source) would be an illusion.","All accuracy disputes,All articles needing expert attention,Articles needing expert attention from November 2019,Articles needing expert attention with no reason or talk parameter,Articles with disputed statements from July 2020,Articles with disputed statements from November 2019,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Deception,Illusions,Neuroscience articles needing expert attention,Perception,Reality,Short description is different from Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Illusion,Иллюзии,"0.053,0.0441,0.0381,0.1374,0.0307,0.0359,0.03,0.0293,0.0767,0.0204,0.1922,0.0189,0.0381,0.0537,0.0196,0.0337,0.0796,0.0256,0.0189,0.0241",https://images.pexels.com/photos/38602/kaleidoscope-dream-illusion-abstract-38602.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

168,slack lining,New Guys,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guys,"""New Guys"" is the first episode of the ninth season of the American comedy television series The Office, and the show's 177th episode overall. It originally aired on NBC on September 20, 2012. The episode was written and directed by series creator Greg Daniels; this is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season episode ""Goodbye, Michael"", and his first directing credit since ""PDA"".
The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, two new employees (Clark Duke and Jake Lacy) are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns from manager training, hoping for revenge on Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) considers adopting Angela Lipton's (Angela Kinsey) cat. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) tries to save a turtle.
""New Guys"" was the inception of several story arcs and saw the departures of Mindy Kaling as Kelly Kapoor and B. J. Novak as Ryan Howard, due to their involvement in the former's own sitcom The Mindy Project. ""New Guys"" received largely positive pre-release reviews from television critics. Post-release reviews were mixed; while many felt that the episode was a distinct step in the right direction for the show, others took issues with some of the comedic aspects of the episode. ""New Guys"" was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, making it the show's lowest-rated season premiere. The episode ranked second in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.","2012 American television episodes,Articles with short description,Good articles,Short description is different from Wikidata,Television episode articles with short description for single episodes,The Office (American season 9) episodes",Slack Lining,Слэклайн,"0.036,0.042,0.0259,0.0386,0.0191,0.0327,0.0216,0.0191,0.0615,0.0657,0.0191,0.0259,0.0276,0.0547,0.0191,0.0276,0.0216,0.0242,0.0242,0.394",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7245223/pexels-photo-7245223.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
169,dolls,Doll,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball,"A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.
Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus. The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame. Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.
As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word ""ball"" may refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects.

170,snowshoeing,Snowshoe,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowshoe,"A snowshoe is footwear for walking over snow. Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called ""flotation"". Snowshoeing is a form of hiking.
Traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with rawhide lacings. Some modern snowshoes are similar, but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal, plastic, and synthetic fabric. In addition to distributing the weight, snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability. They must not accumulate snow, hence the latticework, and require bindings to attach them to the feet.
In the past, snowshoes were essential tools for fur traders, trappers and anyone whose life or living depended on the ability to get around in areas of deep and frequent snowfall, and they remain necessary equipment for forest rangers and others who must be able to get around areas inaccessible to motorized vehicles when the snow is deep. However, snowshoes are mainly used today for recreation, primarily by hikers and runners who like to continue their hobby in wintertime. Snowshoeing is easy to learn and in appropriate conditions is a relatively safe and inexpensive recreational activity. However, snowshoeing in icy, steep terrain can be more dangerous.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2006,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking in-text citations from November 2020,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2010,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Folk footwear,Footwear,Hiking equipment,Short description is different from Wikidata,Snow,Snowshoeing,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers",Snowshoeing,Снегоступы,"0.0416,0.0478,0.0338,0.0175,0.0493,0.0447,0.0369,0.2257,0.0221,0.0524,0.0338,0.0649,0.0307,0.0245,0.0299,0.0377,0.1115,0.0183,0.0338,0.0431",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6739398/pexels-photo-6739398.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
171,collecting music albums,Album,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album,"An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records  played at 33+1⁄3 rpm.
The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the compact cassette during the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s, sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s.
Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or ""mixed"" together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed ""live"", even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some ""live rooms"", have reverberation, which creates a ""live"" sound. Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track.
Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. Historically, the term ""album"" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later, collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When long-playing records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an ""album""; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.

Infrared-sensitive signaling devices are commonly worn by each player to register hits and are sometimes integrated within the arena in which the game is played.
Since its birth in 1979, with the release of the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of Milton Bradley, laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of close quarter combat, role play-style adventure games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals.  Laser tag is popular with a wide range of ages.

173,impersonations,Impersonator,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impersonator,"An impersonator is someone who imitates or copies the behavior or actions of another.  There are many reasons for impersonating someone:

Entertainment: An entertainer impersonates a celebrity, generally for entertainment, and makes fun of their personal lives, recent scandals and known behavior patterns. Especially popular objects of impersonation are Elvis Presley (see Elvis impersonator) and Michael Jackson (see Michael Jackson impersonator). Entertainers who impersonate multiple celebrities as part of their act, can be sorted into impressionists and celebrity impersonators. Male drag queens have traditionally been called ""female impersonators"", although this terminology is now considered outdated.
Crime: As part of a criminal act such as identity theft. This is usually where the criminal is trying to assume the identity of another, in order to commit fraud, such as accessing confidential information, or to gain property not belonging to them. Also known as social engineering and impostors.
Decoys, used as a form of protection for political and military figures. This involves an impersonator who is employed (or forced) to perform during public appearances, to mislead observers.
Sowing discord, causing people to fight, or dislike each other for social, business or political gain.
Companionship: a rental family service provides actors portraying friends or family for platonic purposes.","Acting,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,All pages needing cleanup,Articles needing additional references from November 2016,Articles needing cleanup from August 2019,Articles with limited geographic scope from August 2019,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2008,Comedy genres,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Crimes,Deception,Impostors,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia list cleanup from August 2019",Impersonations,Перевоплощение,"0.2649,0.0364,0.0192,0.0184,0.034,0.0935,0.0473,0.0293,0.0497,0.0286,0.0192,0.0278,0.0293,0.0661,0.027,0.0646,0.0419,0.0426,0.02,0.0403",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6842313/pexels-photo-6842313.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
174,philosophy,Philosophy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,"Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE), others dispute this story, arguing that Pythagoreans merely claimed use of a preexisting term.  Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, ""natural philosophy"" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics.
In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.
Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises. Other notable subfields include philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing Greek-language text,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing Pali-language text,Articles containing Sanskrit-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2020,CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of May 2021,CS1 maint: postscript,Humanities,Main topic articles,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Philosophy,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from April 2016,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Philosophy,Философия,"0.1729,0.033,0.0212,0.3193,0.0291,0.048,0.0186,0.0232,0.0206,0.0271,0.0265,0.0154,0.0173,0.0265,0.0376,0.0435,0.0199,0.0252,0.0186,0.0565",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7958031/pexels-photo-7958031.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It is becoming more popular in areas of North America such as New England,Southcentral Alaska, and Nova Scotia.While Nordic skating usually involves tours over open ice on marshes, lakes, rivers, or sea, in the Netherlands skaters follow marked routes on frozen canals and connected lakes. Consequently, there are differences in equipment and skating styles between these two regions. Alaskans often include winter camping on longer journeys of a hundred miles or more.
Nordic skating is a popular activity in Sweden but is also becoming more popular in Finland and Norway, where it is called långfärdsskridskoåkning (in Swedish), retkiluistelu (in Finnish) and turskøyting (in Norwegian). In Canada and the United States this style is often called Nordic skating. Other names used are trip skating and wild skating.

A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change. 
Thus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2009,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Culture,Main topic articles,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata mismatch,Short description is different from Wikidata,Social concepts,Social constructionism,Use mdy dates from July 2015,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from January 2018,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Cultural,Культурология,"0.2827,0.0202,0.0202,0.0449,0.0992,0.0193,0.0564,0.0284,0.021,0.0374,0.0259,0.0193,0.0737,0.0588,0.0416,0.0267,0.0366,0.0185,0.0383,0.0309",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5493270/pexels-photo-5493270.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

181,self-improvement,Self-help,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help,"Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvement—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis.
When engaged in self-help, people often utilize publicly available information or support groups, on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together. From early examples in self-driven legal practice and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to education, business, psychology and psychotherapy, commonly distributed through the popular genre of self-help books. According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, identity, meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.
Groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and caregivers. As well as featuring long-time members sharing experiences, these health groups can become support groups and clearing-houses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying about health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer or mutual-support groups.

182,sightseeing,Tourism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism,"Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.  The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go ""beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only"", as people ""traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes"". Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.
Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, but slowly recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt  end to the growth. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58% to 78% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012, emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, as well as other significant environmental and social impacts that are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. For this reason, many tourist development organizations are beginning to focus on sustainable tourism in order to mitigate negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism. The  United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs like the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017, and programs like Tourism for SDGs focusing on how SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 14 implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy.","1770s neologisms,All Wikipedia articles needing clarification,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text,Articles containing Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2011,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from February 2013,Articles needing additional references from January 2021,Articles needing additional references from July 2017,Articles needing additional references from June 2021,Articles needing additional references from September 2018,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with excerpts,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2020,CS1 German-language sources (de),Pages using Sister project links with default search,Short description matches Wikidata,Tourism,Use dmy dates from April 2020,Vague or ambiguous time from June 2021,Vague or ambiguous time from May 2020,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2017,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2013,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from December 2018,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers",Sightseeing,Осмотр достопримечательностей,"0.0467,0.1359,0.0128,0.0258,0.017,0.0258,0.0149,0.0712,0.018,0.018,0.0159,0.0295,0.0133,0.03,0.0185,0.0409,0.0206,0.0201,0.3258,0.0994",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7245106/pexels-photo-7245106.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

184,artwork,Work of art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_of_art,"A work of art, artwork, art piece, piece of art or art object is an artistic creation of aesthetic value. Except for ""work of art"", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply principally to tangible, physical forms of visual art: 

An example of fine art, such as a painting or sculpture.
An object that has been designed specifically for its aesthetic appeal, such as a piece of jewellery.
An object that has been designed for aesthetic appeal as well as functional purpose, as in interior design and much folk art.
An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by cultural outsiders).
A non-ephemeral photograph or film.
A work of installation art or conceptual art.Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:

A fine work of architecture or landscape design
A production of live performance, such as theater, ballet, opera, performance art, musical concert and other performing arts, and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as aural-music and written word-literature have similar issues and philosophies.  The term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.","All articles with unsourced statements,Art,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2014,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Concepts in aesthetics,Design,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Short description is different from Wikidata,Visual arts,Visual arts media,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Works of art",Artwork,Произведения искусства,"0.024,0.0319,0.0179,0.0155,0.4848,0.0301,0.0185,0.0161,0.0738,0.0179,0.0222,0.0216,0.0713,0.0228,0.0313,0.0331,0.0155,0.0155,0.0161,0.0203",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1293120/pexels-photo-1293120.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The archaic term ""suit in law"" is found in only a small number of laws still in effect today. The term ""lawsuit"" is used in reference to a civil action brought in a court of law in which a plaintiff, a party who claims to have incurred loss as a result of a defendant's actions, demands a legal or equitable remedy. The defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff's complaint. If the plaintiff is successful, judgment is in the plaintiff's favor, and a variety of court orders may be issued to enforce a right, award damages, or impose a temporary or permanent injunction to prevent an act or compel an act. A declaratory judgment may be issued to prevent future legal disputes.
A lawsuit may involve dispute resolution of private law issues between individuals, business entities or non-profit organizations. A lawsuit may also enable the state to be treated as if it were a private party in a civil case, as plaintiff, or defendant regarding an injury, or may provide the state with a civil cause of action to enforce certain laws.
The conduct of a lawsuit is called litigation. The plaintiffs and defendants are called litigants and the attorneys representing them are called litigators. The term litigation may also refer to a criminal procedure.

186,autogenic training,Autogenic training,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogenic_training,"Autogenic training is a desensitization-relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz by which a psychophysiologically determined relaxation response is obtained. The technique was first published in 1932. Studying the self-reports of people immersed in a hypnotic state, J.H. Schultz noted that physiological changes are accompanied by certain feelings. Abbé Faria and Émile Coué are the forerunners of Schultz. The technique involves repetitions of a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation and is based on passive concentration of bodily perceptions (e.g., heaviness and warmth of arms, legs), which are facilitated by self-suggestions. The technique is used to alleviate many stress-induced psychosomatic disorders.Biofeedback practitioners integrate basic elements of autogenic imagery and have simplified versions of parallel techniques that are used in combination with biofeedback. This was done at the Menninger Foundation by Elmer Green, Steve Fahrio, Patricia Norris, Joe Sargent, Dale Walters and others. They incorporated the hand warming imagery of autogenic training and used it as an aid to develop thermal biofeedback.

187,bookbinding,Bookbinding,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookbinding,"Bookbinding is the process of physically assembling a book of codex format from an ordered stack of paper sheets that are folded together into sections called signatures or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. Several signatures are then bound together along one edge with a thick needle and sturdy thread. Alternative methods of binding that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards, including identifying information and decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can also greatly enhance a book's content by creating book-like objects with artistic merit of exceptional quality.
Before the computer age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was stationery binding (known as vellum binding in the trade) that deals with books intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as notebooks, manifold books, day books, diaries and portfolios. Computers have now replaced the pen and paper based accounting that constituted most of the stationery binding industry. Second was letterpress binding which deals with making books intended for reading, including library binding, fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings. A third division deals with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings.
Today, modern bookbinding is divided between hand binding by individual craftsmen working in a shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high-speed machines in a factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from one-of-a-kind custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large-run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. For the largest numbers of copies, commercial binding is effected by production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory.","All articles to be expanded,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles prone to spam from April 2013,Articles to be expanded from February 2013,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2018,Book arts,Book design,Book publishing,Bookbinding,CS1 German-language sources (de),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Crafts,Egyptian inventions,Graphic design,Paper art,Print production,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from March 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from Popular Science Monthly,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers",Bookbinding,Переплетение книг,"0.0512,0.0594,0.0279,0.0106,0.0486,0.3699,0.0153,0.0218,0.0158,0.0789,0.021,0.0413,0.0141,0.0106,0.11,0.0218,0.0339,0.0119,0.0223,0.0136",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1526049/pexels-photo-1526049.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Renaissance fairs generally include an abundance of costumed entertainers or fair-goers, musical and theatrical acts, art and handicrafts for sale, and festival food. Some offer campgrounds for those who wish to stay more than one day.Many Renaissance fairs are set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Some are set earlier, during the reign of Henry VIII, or in other countries, such as France, and some are set outside the era of the Renaissance; these may include earlier medieval periods (including Vikings), or later periods, such as 17th- or 18th-century pirates. Some engage in deliberate ""time travel"" by encouraging participants to wear costumes representing several eras in a broad time period. Renaissance fairs encourage visitors to enter into the spirit of things with costumes and audience participation. Many welcome fantasy elements such as wizards and elves.","All articles to be expanded,Articles to be expanded from April 2010,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Festivals in the United States,Historical reenactment events,History festivals by period,Renaissance fair,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Renaissance Faire,Ярмарка эпохи Возрождения,"0.0531,0.021,0.0185,0.03,0.0399,0.2704,0.0317,0.0498,0.03,0.021,0.0259,0.0317,0.0786,0.0226,0.021,0.1025,0.0671,0.0235,0.0358,0.0259",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3358880/pexels-photo-3358880.png?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
189,brewing beer,Beer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear,"Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.  Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.
While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.
Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.","Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text,Articles containing Swedish-language text,Articles containing video clips,""Articles with species microformats"",Articles with short description,Bears,CS1: long volume value,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 Latin-language sources (la),CS1 Russian-language sources (ru),Commons link is on Wikidata,Extant Eocene first appearances,Good articles,Predators,Short description matches Wikidata,Taxa named by Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Brewing Beer,Варить пиво,"0.0222,0.0337,0.0199,0.0366,0.0452,0.0694,0.0176,0.0527,0.0176,0.0573,0.0204,0.0331,0.0504,0.3066,0.0153,0.0296,0.0463,0.0291,0.0498,0.0475",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1267681/pexels-photo-1267681.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
190,scuba diving,Scuba diving,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving,"Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses an apparatus which is completely independent of surface supply to breathe underwater. The name ""scuba"", an acronym of ""Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus"", was first used by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers. Although the use of compressed air is common, a mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become popular due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives. Breathing gas diluted with helium may be used to reduce nitrogen narcosis. 
Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for range extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing gas . Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.A scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface. Other equipment needed for scuba diving includes a mask to improve underwater vision, exposure protection by means of a diving suit, ballast weights to overcome excess buoyancy, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive, which may include a snorkel when swimming on the surface, a cutting tool to manage entanglement, lights, a dive computer to monitor decompression status, and signalling devices. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by diving instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, but a higher level of fitness may be appropriate for some applications.","All articles with self-published sources,Articles with self-published sources from January 2018,Articles with short description,CS1: long volume value,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 Hebrew-language sources (he),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Diving equipment configurations,Good articles,Outdoor recreation,Recreational diving,Short description matches Wikidata,Underwater diving procedures,Use British English from August 2016,Use dmy dates from September 2020,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Scuba Diving,Подводное плавание с аквалангом,"0.0265,0.0196,0.0568,0.0316,0.0159,0.0122,0.0568,0.0813,0.0115,0.5221,0.0345,0.0163,0.013,0.0221,0.0119,0.0185,0.0119,0.0104,0.0144,0.0126",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2404365/pexels-photo-2404365.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The practice of treasure-hunting can be controversial, as locations such as sunken wrecks or cultural sites may be protected by national or international law concerned with property ownership, marine salvage, sovereign or state vessels, commercial diving regulations, protection of cultural heritage and trade controls.
Treasure hunting can also refer to geocaching – a sport in which participants use GPS units to find hidden caches of toys or trinkets, or various other treasure-hunting games.","All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles lacking in-text citations from May 2009,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2020,Short description matches Wikidata,Treasure",Treasure hunting,Охота за сокровищами,"0.0383,0.1357,0.0341,0.0519,0.0278,0.033,0.0257,0.0288,0.0257,0.0341,0.0351,0.054,0.0781,0.0603,0.0299,0.0477,0.1169,0.0372,0.0561,0.0498",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7169552/pexels-photo-7169552.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
192,badminton,Badminton,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton,"Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are ""singles"" (with one player per side) and ""doubles"" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.","All articles needing additional references,All articles that may contain original research,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from September 2009,Articles that may contain original research from May 2010,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2012,Badminton,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown,Olympic sports,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Racquet sports,Short description matches Wikidata,Sports originating in South Asia,Summer Olympic sports,Use dmy dates from February 2016,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from EB9,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Badminton,Бадминтон,"0.019,0.0365,0.0209,0.0172,0.0215,0.0165,0.0396,0.0259,0.0321,0.0509,0.0815,0.059,0.0321,0.0147,0.0215,0.0234,0.0203,0.3948,0.0453,0.0272",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8007205/pexels-photo-8007205.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
193,soccer,Association football,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football,"Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer, is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal, usually within a time frame of 90 or more minutes.
Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference and known as the football. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area. Players may use any other part of their body to strike or pass the ball, and mainly use their feet. The team that scores more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the format of the competition. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.Football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for men and women every four years. The men's FIFA World Cup has taken place every four years since 1930, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament is held every four years and involves 32 national teams competing over four weeks.

194,meteorology,Meteorology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology,"Meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences (which include atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics), with a major focus on weather forecasting. The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not begin until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data. It was not until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved. An important branch of weather forecasting is marine weather forecasting as it relates to maritime and coastal safety, in which weather effects also include atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water.
Meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology. Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of Earth's atmosphere: temperature, air pressure, water vapour, mass flow, and the variations and interactions of these variables, and how they change over time. Different spatial scales are used  to describe and predict weather on local, regional, and global levels.
Meteorology, climatology, atmospheric physics, and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences. Meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology. The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, energy production, transport, agriculture, and construction.
The word meteorology is from the Ancient Greek μετέωρος metéōros (meteor) and -λογία -logia (-(o)logy), meaning ""the study of things high in the air.""","All articles with dead external links,All pages needing factual verification,Applied and interdisciplinary physics,Articles with dead external links from January 2018,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: location,CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,CS1 maint: others,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Greek words and phrases,Meteorology,Oceanography,Physical geography,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from October 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from September 2010,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Meteorology,Метеорология,"0.0543,0.0352,0.0486,0.1622,0.0194,0.0454,0.0225,0.0244,0.0156,0.0454,0.046,0.0321,0.0467,0.0181,0.0251,0.0156,0.0352,0.0257,0.2575,0.0251",https://images.pexels.com/photos/907485/pexels-photo-907485.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
195,microscopy,Microscopy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope,"A microscope (from the Ancient Greek: μικρός, mikrós, ""small"" and σκοπεῖν, skopeîn, ""to look"" or ""see"") is a laboratory instrument used to examine objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using a microscope. Microscopic means being invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.
There are many types of microscopes, and they may be grouped in different ways. One way is to describe the method an instrument uses to interact with a sample and produce images, either by sending a beam of light or electrons through a sample in its optical path, by detecting photon emissions from a sample, or by scanning across and a short distance from the surface of a sample using a probe. The most common microscope (and the first to be invented) is the optical microscope, which uses lenses to refract visible light that passed through a thinly sectioned sample to produce an observable image. Other major types of microscopes are the fluorescence microscope, electron microscope (both the transmission electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope) and various types of scanning probe microscopes.

196,creative writing,Creative writing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_writing,"Creative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stage—screenwriting and playwriting—are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.
Creative writing can technically be considered any writing of original composition. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the variety of its genres. In her work, Foundations of Creativity, Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant's Teaching the People's Language to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:

Witty and LaBrant…[say creative writing] is a composition of any type of writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as
the need for keeping records of significant experience,
the need for sharing experience with an interested group, and
the need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from August 2010,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2009,CS1 maint: others,Communication design,Creativity,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Writing",Creative writing,Креативное письмо,"0.2252,0.0199,0.0154,0.1141,0.0618,0.1056,0.0206,0.0376,0.0657,0.0343,0.018,0.0284,0.0324,0.0265,0.0513,0.0239,0.0507,0.0271,0.0225,0.0193",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4458554/pexels-photo-4458554.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

198,shopping,Shopping,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping,"Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a  leisure activity.Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of travelling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.
Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.According to a 2000 report, in New York State, women purchase 80% of all consumer goods.","Articles with short description,Commons category link from Wikidata,Shopping (activity),Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Shopping,Шоппинг,"0.0517,0.4295,0.0226,0.0427,0.017,0.0247,0.0184,0.0573,0.0184,0.0156,0.0233,0.0177,0.024,0.0295,0.0247,0.0309,0.0559,0.0226,0.026,0.0476",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1050244/pexels-photo-1050244.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.  By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.  In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.","All accuracy disputes,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing French-language text,Articles with French-language sources (fr),Articles with disputed statements from September 2020,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2012,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2009,Ball games,Broad-concept articles,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Football,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use British English from September 2016,Use dmy dates from November 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2020,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Football,Футбол,"0.0319,0.0252,0.0244,0.0259,0.0199,0.0387,0.0402,0.0274,0.0244,0.0191,0.0252,0.0236,0.083,0.0574,0.0432,0.0552,0.0229,0.3435,0.0447,0.0244",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2570139/pexels-photo-2570139.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The gyotaku method of printmaking uses fish, sea creatures, or similar subjects as its 'printing plates'.
Prints were made using sumi ink and washi paper. It is rumored that samurai would settle fishing competitions using gyotaku prints. This original form of gyotaku, as a recording method for fisherman, is still utilized today, and can be seen hanging in tackle shops in Japan.","All stub articles,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Commons category link from Wikidata,Japanese art,Japanese art stubs,Printmaking,Printmaking stubs,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Gyotaku,Гётаку,"0.0301,0.029,0.0266,0.055,0.068,0.0703,0.0431,0.0372,0.0561,0.0455,0.0278,0.0349,0.0349,0.0266,0.1661,0.0892,0.0266,0.0337,0.0644,0.0349",

202,cross-stitch,Cross-stitch,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-stitch,"Cross-stitch is a form of sewing and a popular form of counted-thread embroidery in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as linen) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (stamped cross-stitch); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern. Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth whose weave creates a plainly visible grid of squares with holes for the needle at each corner.
Fabrics used in cross-stitch include linen, aida, and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave' such as jobelan. All cross-stitch fabrics are technically ""evenweave"" as the term refers to the fact that the fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads per inch in both the warp and the weft (i.e. vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count.
Counted cross-stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern called a chart and can be used on any count fabric; the count of the fabric and the number of threads per stitch determine the size of the finished stitching. For example, if a given design is stitched on a 28 count cross-stitch fabric with each cross worked over two threads, the finished stitching size is the same as it would be on a 14 count aida fabric with each cross worked over one square. These methods are referred to as ""2 over 2"" (2 embroidery threads used to stitch over 2 fabric threads) and ""1 over 1"" (1 embroidery thread used to stitch over 1 fabric thread or square), respectively. There are different methods of stitching a pattern, including the cross-country method where one colour is stitched at a time, or the parking method where one block of fabric is stitched at a time and the end of the thread is ""parked"" at the next point the same colour occurs in the pattern.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles prone to spam from December 2013,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Embroidery stitches,Sewing stitches,Short description matches Wikidata",Cross-Stitch,Вышивка крестиком,"0.0196,0.0218,0.0156,0.0128,0.0252,0.0139,0.0298,0.0275,0.0207,0.04,0.0156,0.0179,0.0196,0.0184,0.5672,0.0354,0.0383,0.0269,0.0207,0.0133",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7129034/pexels-photo-7129034.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. The epoxide functional group is also collectively called epoxy. The IUPAC name for an epoxide group is an oxirane.
Epoxy resins may be reacted (cross-linked) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or with a wide range of co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and acid anhydrides), phenols, alcohols and thiols (usually called mercaptans). These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.
Reaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a thermosetting polymer, often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, fiber-reinforced plastic materials, and adhesives for structural and other purposes.
The health risks associated with exposure to epoxy resin compounds include contact dermatitis and allergic reactions, as well as respiratory problems from breathing vapor and sanding dust, especially when not fully cured.","Adhesives,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from April 2020,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020,Organic polymers,Short description is different from Wikidata,Synthetic resins,Thermosetting plastics,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Epoxy,Эпоксидная смола,"0.0454,0.0274,0.3067,0.0221,0.0589,0.0206,0.0169,0.0477,0.0267,0.0349,0.0559,0.1017,0.0537,0.0342,0.0364,0.0259,0.0252,0.0206,0.0191,0.0199",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6858596/pexels-photo-6858596.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
205,spinning,Spin,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain,"Spain (Spanish: España, [esˈpaɲa] (listen)), formally the Kingdom of Spain (Spanish: Reino de España), is a country in Southwestern Europe with some pockets of territory in Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar and offshore in the Atlantic Ocean. Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula and Its territory also includes two archipelagos: the Canary Islands off the coast of North Africa, and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. The African exclaves of Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have continental African territories. Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory. The country's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean, respectively.
With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second-largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth-largest country by area on the European continent. With a population exceeding 47.3 million, Spain is the sixth-most populous country in Europe, and the fourth-most populous country in the European Union. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia, Palma, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Bilbao.
Anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 42,000 years ago. The first cultures and peoples that developed in current Spanish territory were Pre-Roman peoples such as the ancient Iberians, Celts, Celtiberians, Vascones, Turdetani and Occitans. Later, foreign Mediterranean peoples such as the Phoenicians and ancient Greeks developed coastal trading colonies, and the Carthaginians controlled part of the Spanish Mediterranean coastline. From the year 218 BC, with the taking of the city of Ampurias, the Roman colonization of Hispania began and, with the exception of the Atlantic cornice, they quickly controlled the territory of present-day Spain. The Romans had driven the Carthaginians out of the Iberian peninsula by 206 BC, and divided it into two administrative provinces, Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior. The Romans laid the foundations for modern Spanish culture and identity, and was the birthplace of important Roman emperors such as Trajan, Hadrian or Theodosius I.
Spain remained under Roman rule until the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fourth century, which ushered in Germanic tribal confederations from Central and Northern Europe. During this period, present-day Spain was divided between different Germanic powers, including the Suevi, Alans, Vandals and Visigoths, the latter maintaining an alliance with Rome via foedus, while part of Southern Spain belonged to the Byzantine Empire. Eventually, the Visigoths emerged as the dominant faction by the fifth century, with the Visigothic Kingdom spanning the vast majority of the Iberian Peninsula, and established its capital in the actual city of Toledo. The creation of the code of laws Liber Iudiciorum by the King Recceswinth during the Visigothic period deeply influenced the structural and legal bases of Spain and the survival of Roman Law after the fall of the Roman Empire.
In the early eighth century, the Visigothic Kingdom was invaded by the Umayyad Caliphate, ushering in over 700 years of Muslim rule in Southern Iberia. During this period, Al-Andalus became a major economic and intellectual center, with the city of Córdoba being among the largest and richest in Europe. Several Christian kingdoms emerged in the northern periphery of Iberia, chief among them León, Castile, Aragón, Portugal, and Navarre. Over the next seven centuries, an intermittent southward expansion of these kingdoms—metahistorically framed as a reconquest, or Reconquista—culminated with the Christian seizure of the last Muslim polity, the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, and the control of all Iberia by the Christian kingdoms in 1492. That same year, Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World on behalf of the Catholic Monarchs, whose dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon is usually considered the emergent Spain as a unified country. During the centuries after the Reconquista, the Christian kings of Spain persecuted and expelled ethnic and religious minorities such as Jews and Muslims through the Spanish Inquisition.
From the 16th until the early 19th century, Spain ruled one of the largest empires in history, which was among the first global empires; its immense cultural and linguistic legacy includes over 570 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world's second-most spoken native language. Spain hosts the world's third-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Spain is a secular parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with King Felipe VI as head of state.

206,parachuting,Parachuting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting,"Parachuting, including also skydiving, is a method of transiting from a high point in the atmosphere to the surface of Earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent using a parachute or parachutes. 
For human skydiving, it may involve a phase of more or less free-falling (the skydiving segment) which is a period when the parachute has not yet been deployed and the body gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.  
For cargo parachuting, the parachute descent may begin immediately, such as a parachute-airdrop in the lower atmosphere of Earth, or be significantly delayed, such as in a planetary atmosphere where an object is descending ""under parachute"" following atmospheric entry from space, and may begin only after the hypersonic entry phase and initial deceleration that occurs due to friction with the thin upper atmosphere.","Air sports,All articles needing additional references,All articles with style issues,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from August 2016,Articles needing additional references from September 2009,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020,CS1 Danish-language sources (da),CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Falling,Military sports,Parachuting,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from October 2019,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2016,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from August 2016",Parachuting,Прыжки с парашютом,"0.0233,0.0356,0.0366,0.0271,0.0214,0.0223,0.0385,0.0556,0.0223,0.0774,0.0385,0.0299,0.0641,0.029,0.0375,0.0261,0.2341,0.0233,0.1353,0.0223",https://images.pexels.com/photos/37656/skydiving-jump-falling-parachuting-37656.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
207,warships,Warship,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship,"A warship or combatant ship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.
In wartime, the distinction between warships and merchant ships is often blurred. In war, merchant ships are often armed and used as auxiliary warships, such as the Q-ships of the First World War and the armed merchant cruisers of the Second World War. Until the 17th century it was common for merchant ships to be pressed into naval service and not unusual for more than half a fleet to be composed of merchant ships. Until the threat of piracy subsided in the 19th century, it was normal practice to arm larger merchant ships such as galleons. Warships have also often been used as troop carriers or supply ships, such as by the French Navy in the 18th century or the Japanese Navy during the Second World War.","All articles needing additional references,Articles needing additional references from August 2016,Articles with short description,Naval warfare,Short description is different from Wikidata,Warships,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Warships,Военные корабли,"0.0442,0.0214,0.0269,0.025,0.0487,0.026,0.2964,0.0433,0.0524,0.0542,0.0205,0.0496,0.0205,0.0305,0.025,0.0833,0.0223,0.0205,0.0369,0.0524",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8798471/pexels-photo-8798471.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
208,astrology,Astrology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy,"Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία, literally meaning the science that studies the laws of the stars) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.
Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Greek-language text,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018,Astronomy,CS1 maint: location,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Good articles,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Physical sciences,Short description is different from Wikidata,Solar System,Use dmy dates from April 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Astrology,Астрология,"0.0255,0.015,0.0175,0.5952,0.0157,0.0157,0.0138,0.02,0.0175,0.02,0.0163,0.0206,0.085,0.0169,0.02,0.0163,0.015,0.0218,0.0144,0.0181",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3279307/pexels-photo-3279307.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
209,baking,Baking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank,"A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.
Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords.
Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties — notably, the  Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the  Berenbergs, and the  Rothschilds — have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).","All articles needing additional references,All articles to be expanded,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from May 2016,Articles needing additional references from September 2008,Articles to be expanded from August 2020,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with limited geographic scope from September 2009,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from August 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2019,Banking,Banks,Economic history of Italy,Financial services,Italian inventions,Legal entities,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use Oxford spelling from September 2016,Use dmy dates from December 2019,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from December 2019,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from August 2020,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages",Baking,Выпечка,"0.0332,0.0749,0.0287,0.0399,0.0652,0.0227,0.057,0.0347,0.0198,0.0227,0.025,0.0295,0.0474,0.0347,0.0205,0.1413,0.0354,0.0459,0.0809,0.1406",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1853003/pexels-photo-1853003.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

This history has meant that variations of the sport were created and still exist, it also lead to other three stage races to use the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not consisting of swim, bike, and run elements.Triathletes train to achieve endurance, strength, speed, requiring focused persistent and periodised training for each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning.","All articles to be expanded,All articles with empty sections,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles prone to spam from July 2012,Articles to be expanded from February 2019,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with empty sections from February 2019,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2019,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1: long volume value,CS1 French-language sources (fr),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Cycle racing by discipline,Endurance games,Individual sports,Multisports,Open water swimming,Short description is different from Wikidata,Summer Olympic sports,Triathlon,Use dmy dates from November 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Triathlon,Триатлон,"0.0263,0.0225,0.0398,0.033,0.0235,0.0761,0.0398,0.0666,0.0407,0.0445,0.1604,0.0742,0.0963,0.033,0.0369,0.0216,0.0436,0.0618,0.0244,0.035",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5687403/pexels-photo-5687403.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
212,stained glass,Stained glass,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stained_glass,"The term stained glass refers to coloured glass as a material and to works created from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term ""stained glass"" to include domestic lead light and objets d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.
As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture, and usually then further decorating it in various ways. The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in enamelled glass in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln; very often this technique is only applied to parts of a window.

Stained glass, as an art and a craft, requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages. In Western Europe, together with illuminated manuscripts, they constitute the major form of medieval pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as ""illuminated wall decorations"".
The design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the Bible, history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church – episodes from the life of Christ; within a parliament building – shields of the constituencies; within a college hall – figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home – flora, fauna, or landscape.","All articles needing additional references,Articles incorporating a citation from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia with Wikisource reference,Articles needing additional references from April 2017,Articles prone to spam from March 2014,Articles with short description,Commons link is on Wikidata,Decorative arts,Glass architecture,Glass production,History of glass,Short description is different from Wikidata,Stained glass,Use dmy dates from May 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Windows",Stained Glass,Витражное стекло,"0.0314,0.0129,0.1133,0.0158,0.2829,0.0217,0.0348,0.0163,0.0295,0.0422,0.0217,0.0207,0.0363,0.0178,0.1133,0.0339,0.0178,0.0144,0.0461,0.0772",https://images.pexels.com/photos/33591/church-window-baptism-sacrament-glass-window.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
213,brazilian jiu-jitsu,Brazilian jiu-jitsu,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu,"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ; ; Portuguese: [ˈʒiw ˈʒit(i)su], [ˈʒu ˈʒit(i)su], [dʒiˈu dʒit(i)ˈsu], jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a martial art and combat sport based on ground fighting (ne-waza) and submission holds. It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was developed around 1920 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George, and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught traditional Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917. Later they developed their own self-defense system named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.
BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and judo, becoming an essential martial art for MMA. Governing bodies such as the IBJJF work worldwide, and set the rules and standards to be held in BJJ competitions.BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend him/herself against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling and self-defense situations. Sparring, commonly referred to as ""rolling"" within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.

214,digital photography,Digital photography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography,"Digital photography uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to produce images focused by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic film. The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing, viewing, electronic publishing, or digital printing. 
Until the advent of such technology, photographs were made by exposing light sensitive photographic film and paper, which was processed in liquid chemical solutions to develop and stabilize the image. Digital photographs are typically created solely by computer-based photoelectric and mechanical techniques, without wet bath chemical processing.
The first consumer digital cameras were marketed in the late 1990s. Professionals gravitated to digital slowly, and were won over when their professional work required using digital files to fulfill the demands of employers and/or clients, for faster turn-around than conventional methods would allow. Starting around 2000, digital cameras were incorporated in cell phones and in the following years, cell phone cameras became widespread, particularly due to their connectivity to social media websites and email. Since 2010, the digital point-and-shoot and DSLR formats have also seen competition from the mirrorless digital camera format, which typically provides better image quality than the point-and-shoot or cell phone formats but comes in a smaller size and shape than the typical DSLR. Many mirrorless cameras accept interchangeable lenses and have advanced features through an electronic viewfinder, which replaces the through-the-lens finder image of the SLR format.","All Wikipedia articles in need of updating,All articles that may contain original research,All articles with failed verification,Articles that may contain original research from August 2015,Articles with failed verification from September 2011,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,Digital photography,Short description is different from Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles in need of updating from August 2015,Wikipedia articles in need of updating from February 2018,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Digital Photography,Цифровая фотография,"0.029,0.1826,0.0996,0.0228,0.0484,0.0284,0.0222,0.0153,0.1932,0.084,0.0178,0.0222,0.0247,0.0234,0.0353,0.0265,0.0384,0.0365,0.0234,0.0265",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7014329/pexels-photo-7014329.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

216,surfing,Surfing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing,"Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer, uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
The term surfing usually refers to the act of riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.
Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.
In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking that are self-propelled by hand paddles do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. As of 2013, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized a 23.8 m (78 ft) wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.During the winter season in the northern hemisphere, the north shore of Oahu, the third-largest island of Hawaii, is known for having some of the best waves in the world. Surfers from around the world flock to beaches like Backdoor, Waimea Bay, and Pipeline.

Customarily, coupons are issued by manufacturers of consumer packaged goods or by retailers, to be used in retail stores as a part of sales promotions.  They are often widely distributed through mail, coupon envelopes, magazines, newspapers, the Internet (social media, email newsletter), directly from the retailer, and mobile devices such as cell phones.
The New York Times reported ""more than 900 manufacturers' coupons were distributed"" per household, and that ""the United States Department of Agriculture estimates that four families in five use coupons. ""Only about 4 percent"" of
coupons received were redeemed. Coupons can be targeted selectively to regional markets in which price competition is great.
Most coupons have an expiration date, although American military commissaries overseas honor manufacturers' coupons for up to six months past the expiration date.

219,radio-controlled car racing,Radio-controlled car,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_car,"Radio-controlled cars (or RC cars for short) are miniature model cars or trucks that can be controlled from a distance using a specialized transmitter or remote. The term ""RC"" has been used to mean both ""remote controlled"" and ""radio controlled"", where ""remote controlled"" includes vehicles that are controlled by radio, infrared or a physical wire connection (the latter is now obsolete). Common use of ""RC"" today usually refers only to vehicles controlled by radio, and this article focuses on radio-controlled vehicles only.Cars are powered by various sources. Electric models are powered by small but powerful electric motors and rechargeable nickel-cadmium, nickel metal hydride, or lithium polymer cells. There are also brushed or brushless electric motors - brushless motors are more powerful and efficient, but also much more expensive than brushed motors. Most fuel-powered models use glow plug engines, small internal combustion engines fueled by a special mixture of nitromethane, methanol, and oil (in most cases a blend of castor oil and synthetic oil). These are referred to as ""nitro"" cars. Recently, exceptionally large models have been introduced that are powered by small gasoline engines, similar to string trimmer motors, which use a mix of oil and gasoline. Electric cars are generally considered easier to work with compared to fuel-driven models, but can be equally as complex at the higher budget and skill levels. Both electric and nitro models can be very fast, although electric is easier to upgrade and more versatile.
In both of these categories, both on-road and off-road vehicles are available. Off-road models, which are built with fully functional off-road suspensions and a wide tire selection, can be used on various types of terrain. On-road cars, with a much less robust suspension, are limited to smooth, paved surfaces. There are also rally cars, which fall somewhere between on-road and off-roadand can be driven on gravel, dirt or other loose surfaces. In the past decade, advances in ""on-road"" vehicles have made their suspension as adjustable as many full scale race cars, today.","All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles lacking reliable references,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking in-text citations from November 2015,Articles lacking reliable references from November 2011,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,CS1 errors: requires URL,Radio-controlled cars,Short description is different from Wikidata,Toy cars and trucks",Radio-controlled car racing,Радиоуправляемые автомобильные гонки,"0.0134,0.0194,0.0452,0.0215,0.0492,0.0124,0.024,0.076,0.0341,0.0316,0.0124,0.4801,0.0139,0.0154,0.0351,0.024,0.0225,0.0139,0.0391,0.0169",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6872585/pexels-photo-6872585.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
220,floral design,Floral design,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floral_design,"Floral design or flower arrangement is the art of using plant materials and flowers to create an eye-catching and balanced composition or display. Evidence of refined floristry is found as far back as the culture of ancient Egypt. Professionally designed floral designs, arrangements or artwork incorporate the elements of floral design: line, form, space, texture, and color, and the principles of floral design: balance, proportion, rhythm, contrast, harmony, and unity.There are many styles of floral design including Botanical Style, Garden Style (Hand Tied, Compote or Armature), Crescent Corsage, Nosegay Corsage, Pot au Fleur, Inverted ""T"", Parallel Systems, Western Line, Hedgerow Design, Mille de Fleur, and Formal Linear.The Eastern, Western, and European styles have all influenced the commercial floral industry as it is today. Ikebana is a Japanese style of floral design, and incorporates the three main line placements of heaven, human, and earth. In contrast, the European style emphasizes color and variety of botanical materials not limited to just blooming flowers, in mass gatherings of multiple flowers. Western design historically is characterized by symmetrical, asymmetrical, horizontal, and vertical style of arrangements.
In addition to flower arrangements, floral design includes making wreaths, nosegays, garlands, festoons, boutonnieres, corsages, and bows.","All articles needing additional references,Articles needing additional references from June 2016,Arts occupations,Design,Floristry,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers",Floral design,Флористика,"0.0193,0.0308,0.0207,0.0274,0.1555,0.1277,0.0362,0.0193,0.0566,0.0261,0.022,0.0281,0.0261,0.0965,0.0742,0.0254,0.106,0.0173,0.0566,0.0281",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7262770/pexels-photo-7262770.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
221,lacrosse,Lacrosse,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse,"Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America, with its origins in a tribal game played by the indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands and by various other indigenous peoples of North America. The game was extensively modified by European colonizers, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.The modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations. The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years. Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908. It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.

Traditional tile-based games use small tiles as playing pieces for gambling or entertainment games.  Some board games use tiles to create their board, giving multiple possibilities for board layout, or allowing changes in the board geometry during play.
Each tile has a back (undifferentiated) side and a face side.  Domino tiles are usually rectangular, twice as long as they are wide and at least twice as wide as they are thick, though games exist with square tiles, triangular tiles and even hexagonal tiles.","All articles lacking sources,Articles lacking sources from December 2009,Tile-based board games,Tile-based video games,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers",Tile-based games,Тайловая графика,"0.0304,0.043,0.0304,0.0304,0.0326,0.0361,0.0315,0.0292,0.0338,0.0304,0.0338,0.0258,0.0304,0.0315,0.2331,0.0372,0.0956,0.1323,0.0269,0.0258",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4836525/pexels-photo-4836525.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
223,traveling,Travel,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade,"Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.
An early form of trade, the Gift economy, saw the exchange of goods and services without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards. A gift economy involves trading things without the use of money. Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. The  invention of money (and later of credit, paper money and  non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade.  Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade.
In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity—including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations.
Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.
Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.","All articles with dead external links,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with dead external links from December 2016,Articles with dead external links from February 2020,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from December 2017,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from September 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2019,CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Short description is different from Wikidata,Society,Trade,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from September 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Traveling,Путешествия,"0.0781,0.4187,0.0267,0.0184,0.0257,0.0233,0.034,0.0326,0.014,0.0179,0.0252,0.0125,0.0242,0.0169,0.0193,0.0448,0.0335,0.013,0.0702,0.0512",https://images.pexels.com/photos/68704/pexels-photo-68704.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

In civil engineering, trenches are often created to install underground utilities such as gas, water, power and communication lines. In construction, trenches are dug for foundations of buildings, retaining walls and dams, and for cut-and-cover construction of tunnels. In archaeology, the ""trench method"" is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material. In geotechnical engineering, trenches serve for locating faults and investigating deep soil properties. In trench warfare, soldiers occupy trenches to protect them against weapons fire. 
Trenches are dug by use of manual tools such as shovels and pickaxes, or by heavy equipment such as backhoes, trenchers and excavators.
For deep trenches, the instability of steep earthen walls requires engineering and safety techniques such as shoring. Trenches are usually considered temporary structures to be backfilled with soil after construction, or abandoned after use. Some trenches are stabilized using durable materials such as concrete to create open passages such as canals and sunken roadways.","Articles with short description,CS1 errors: bare URL,CS1 errors: missing title,Commons category link from Wikidata,Cuts (earthmoving),Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Trance,Транс,"0.0638,0.0149,0.0341,0.0169,0.0499,0.0321,0.0341,0.0188,0.0169,0.0513,0.0367,0.0301,0.0585,0.036,0.0526,0.0195,0.3429,0.0215,0.044,0.0255",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5909574/pexels-photo-5909574.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It can range from chanting slogans to intense physical activity. It can be performed to motivate sports teams, to entertain the audience, or for competition. Cheerleading routines typically range anywhere from one to three minutes, and contain components of tumbling, dance, jumps, cheers, and stunting. 
Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains predominantly in America, with an estimated 3.85 million participants as of 2017. The global presentation of cheerleading was led by the 1997 broadcast of ESPN's International cheerleading competition, and the worldwide release of the 2000 film Bring It On. The International Cheer Union (ICU) now claims 116 member nations with an estimated 7.5 million participants worldwide. The sport has gained a lot of traction in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom with popularity continuing to grow as sport leaders pursue Olympic status.Cheerleading carries the highest rate of catastrophic injuries to girl athletes in sports, with most injuries associated with from stunting, also known as pyramids.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2020,Articles lacking in-text citations from December 2020,Articles needing additional references from November 2016,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with dead external links from January 2021,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2010,CS1 errors: bare URL,CS1 errors: missing title,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Cheerleading,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Concert dance,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports culture,Sports entertainment,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Cheerleading,Черлидинг,"0.0221,0.0247,0.0386,0.0256,0.0265,0.0846,0.0516,0.0273,0.0499,0.0195,0.2244,0.0273,0.0334,0.0334,0.0273,0.023,0.0239,0.0473,0.0942,0.0951",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7321036/pexels-photo-7321036.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
227,metal detecting,Metal detector,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector,"A metal detector is an instrument that detects the presence of metal nearby. Metal detectors are useful for finding metal inclusions hidden within objects, or metal objects buried underground. They often consist of a handheld unit with a sensor probe which can be swept over the ground or other objects. If the sensor comes near a piece of metal this is indicated by a changing tone in earphones, or a needle moving on an indicator. Usually the device gives some indication of distance; the closer the metal is, the higher the tone in the earphone or the higher the needle goes. Another common type are stationary ""walk through"" metal detectors (see § Security screening below) used at access points in prisons, courthouses, and airports to detect concealed metal weapons on a person's body.
The simplest form of a metal detector consists of an oscillator producing an alternating current that passes through a coil producing an alternating magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is close to the coil, eddy currents will be induced (inductive sensor) in the metal, and this produces a magnetic field of its own. If another coil is used to measure the magnetic field (acting as a magnetometer), the change in the magnetic field due to the metallic object can be detected.
The first industrial metal detectors were developed in the 1960s and were used extensively for mineral prospecting and other industrial applications. Uses include detecting land mines, the detection of weapons such as knives and guns (especially in airport security), geophysical prospecting, archaeology and treasure hunting. Metal detectors are also used to detect foreign bodies in food, and in the construction industry to detect steel reinforcing bars in concrete and pipes and wires buried in walls and floors.

229,ceramics,Ceramic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic,"A ceramic is any of the various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature.  Common examples are earthenware, porcelain, and brick.
The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, vitrified, and often completely amorphous (glasses). Most often, fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Varying crystallinity and electron composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and electrical insulators (researched in ceramic engineering). With such a large range of possible options for the composition/structure of a ceramic (nearly all of the elements, nearly all types of bonding, and all levels of crystallinity), the breadth of the subject is vast, and identifiable attributes (hardness, toughness, electrical conductivity) are difficult to specify for the group as a whole. General properties such as high melting temperature, high hardness, poor conductivity, high moduli of elasticity, chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm,  with known exceptions to each of these rules (piezoelectric ceramics, glass transition temperature, superconductive ceramics). Many composites, such as fiberglass and carbon fiber, while containing ceramic materials are not considered to be part of the ceramic family. The earliest ceramics made by humans were pottery objects (pots or vessels) or figurines made from clay, either by itself or mixed with other materials like silica, hardened and sintered in fire. Later, ceramics were glazed and fired to create smooth, colored surfaces, decreasing porosity through the use of glassy, amorphous ceramic coatings on top of the crystalline ceramic substrates. Ceramics now include domestic, industrial and building products, as well as a wide range of ceramic art. In the 20th century, new ceramic materials were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering, such as in semiconductors.
The word ""ceramic"" comes from the Greek word κεραμικός (keramikos), ""of pottery"" or ""for pottery"", from κέραμος (keramos), ""potter's clay, tile, pottery"".  The earliest known mention of the root ""ceram-"" is the Mycenaean Greek ke-ra-me-we, workers of ceramic written in Linear B syllabic script. The word ""ceramic"" may be used as an adjective to describe a material, product or process, or it may be used as a noun, either singular, or more commonly, as the plural noun ""ceramics"".","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,All self-contradictory articles,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles needing additional references from February 2016,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2009,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2011,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Ceramics,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Self-contradictory articles from June 2021,Short description matches Wikidata,Vague or ambiguous time from March 2011,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from December 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers",Ceramics,Керамика,"0.0293,0.016,0.1113,0.0231,0.046,0.015,0.0136,0.0193,0.0503,0.0184,0.0188,0.0284,0.4318,0.0331,0.0503,0.0155,0.0231,0.0155,0.025,0.016",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2855098/pexels-photo-2855098.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
230,textiles,Textile,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile,"To be in exile means to be forced away from one's home (i.e. village, town, city, state, province, territory or even country) and unable to return. People (or corporations and even governments) may be in exile for legal or other reasons.
In Roman law, exsilium denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced. ""Government in exile"" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.

231,alternate reality games,Alternate reality game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game,"An alternate reality game (ARG) is an interactive networked narrative that uses the real world as a platform and employs transmedia storytelling to deliver a story that may be altered by players' ideas or actions.
The form is defined by intense player involvement with a story that takes place in real time and evolves according to players' responses.  Subsequently, it is shaped by characters that are actively controlled by the game's designers, as opposed to being controlled by an AI as in a computer or console video game. Players interact directly with characters in the game, solve plot-based challenges and puzzles, and collaborate as a community to analyze the story and coordinate real-life and online activities. ARGs generally use multimedia, such as telephones, email, and mail but rely on the Internet as the central binding medium.
ARGs tend to be free to play, with costs absorbed either through supporting products (e.g. collectible puzzle cards fund Perplex City) or through promotional relationships with existing products (for example, I Love Bees was a promotion for Halo 2, and the Lost Experience and Find 815 promoted the television show Lost). Pay-to-play models exist as well. Later games in the genre have shown an increasing amount of experimentation with new models and sub-genres.","All articles with dead external links,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Alternate reality games,Articles with dead external links from June 2016,Articles with short description,CS1 errors: generic title,Mixed reality,Short description matches Wikidata,Vague or ambiguous time from April 2013,Video game genres,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2013",Alternate reality games,Игры в альтернативной реальности,"0.1868,0.1846,0.0274,0.0311,0.0398,0.0581,0.0296,0.0245,0.0223,0.0333,0.0186,0.0369,0.0172,0.0281,0.0296,0.0464,0.0252,0.0874,0.0208,0.0523",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4874503/pexels-photo-4874503.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
232,social networking,Social networking service,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service,"A social networking service (also social networking site or social media) is an online platform which people use to build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections.Social networking services vary in format and the number of features. They can incorporate a range of new information and communication tools, operating on desktops and on laptops, on mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. They may feature digital photo/video/sharing and diary entries online (blogging). Online community services are sometimes considered social-network services by developers and users, though in a broader sense, a social-network service usually provides an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Defined as ""websites that facilitate the building of a network of contacts in order to exchange various types of content online,"" social networking sites provide a space for interaction to continue beyond in person interactions. These computer mediated interactions link members of various networks and may help to both maintain and develop new social and professional relationships.Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, digital photos and videos, posts, and to inform others about online or real-world activities and events with people in their network. While in-person social networking – such as gathering in a village market to talk about events – has existed since the earliest development of towns, the web enables people to connect with others who live in different locations, ranging from across a city to across the world. Depending on the social media platform, members may be able to contact any other member. In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on. The success of social networking services can be seen in their dominance in society today, with Facebook having a massive 2.13 billion active monthly users and an average of 1.4 billion daily active users in 2017. LinkedIn, a career-oriented social-networking service, generally requires that a member personally know another member in real life before they contact them online. Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to contact other members.
The main types of social networking services contain category places (such as age or occupation or religion), means to connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and a recommendation system linked to trust. One can categorize social-network services into four types:
socialization social network services used primarily for socializing with existing friends (e.g., Facebook)
online social networks are decentralized and distributed computer networks where users communicate with each other through internet services.
networking social network services used primarily for non-social interpersonal communication (e.g., LinkedIn, a career- and employment-oriented site)
social navigation social network services used primarily for helping users to find specific information or resources (e.g., Goodreads for books)There have been attempts to standardize these services to avoid the need to duplicate entries of friends and interests (see the FOAF standard). A study reveals that India recorded world's largest growth in terms of social media users in 2013.
A 2013 survey found that 73% of U.S. adults use social-networking sites.","All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with incomplete citations,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles lacking reliable references from November 2019,Articles with dead external links from October 2019,Articles with incomplete citations from November 2019,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2011,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2014,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of May 2021,CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Pages incorrectly using the Blockquote template,Short description is different from Wikidata,Social networking services,Use mdy dates from July 2018,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from November 2019",Social Networking,Социальные сети,"0.5048,0.1049,0.0122,0.0402,0.0235,0.0288,0.0479,0.0108,0.0094,0.0373,0.0115,0.0101,0.0161,0.0175,0.0094,0.0331,0.0228,0.0094,0.0246,0.0257",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7129048/pexels-photo-7129048.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
233,backgammon,Backgammon,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon,"Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archaeological discoveries in Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq. It is a two-player game where each player has fifteen pieces (checkers or men) that move between twenty-four triangles (points) according to the roll of two dice. The objective of the game is to be first to bear off, i.e. move all fifteen checkers off the board. Backgammon is a member of the tables family of games, one of the oldest classes of board games.
Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over a series of many games. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.
Like chess, backgammon has been studied with great interest by computer scientists. Owing to this research, backgammon software such as TD-Gammon has been developed that is capable of beating world-class human players.","All Wikipedia articles needing clarification,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Arabic-language text,Articles containing Armenian-language text,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing Greek-language text,Articles containing Korean-language text,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing Medieval Greek-language text,Articles containing Middle English (1100-1500)-language text,Articles containing Persian-language text,Articles containing Turkmen-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2020,Backgammon,CS1: long volume value,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Iranian inventions,Short description is different from Wikidata,Short description matches Wikidata,Spoken articles,Sports originating in Iran,Tables games,Traditional board games,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from November 2018,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Backgammon,Нарды,"0.022,0.0556,0.0228,0.0668,0.0306,0.0194,0.0642,0.0306,0.0289,0.0659,0.034,0.0452,0.0487,0.0426,0.0375,0.0237,0.0685,0.183,0.0444,0.0659",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4491532/pexels-photo-4491532.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India). In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.
According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.","All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing German-language text,Articles lacking reliable references from October 2014,Articles lacking reliable references from September 2014,Articles prone to spam from May 2014,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019,CS1 errors: missing periodical,Commons link is on Wikidata,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Motorcycle technology,Motorcycles,Motorcycling,Short description matches Wikidata,Use British English from January 2020,Use dmy dates from September 2020,Wheeled vehicles,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Motorcycles,Мотоциклы,"0.0344,0.0519,0.0354,0.0335,0.0308,0.0308,0.0482,0.2502,0.0216,0.0335,0.0308,0.1125,0.0427,0.0381,0.0243,0.0225,0.0207,0.0234,0.0592,0.0556",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2949302/pexels-photo-2949302.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

There are multiple subsets of skipping/jump rope, including single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three-person speed (Double Dutch), and three-person freestyle (Double Dutch freestyle).
There are a few major organizations that support jump rope as a sport. Often separated by sex and age, events include hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. In the US, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hits the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.","Aerobic exercise,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from April 2013,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2020,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Games of physical skill,""Girls toys and games"",Jumping sports,Physical activity and dexterity toys,Short description matches Wikidata,Traditional toys,Use dmy dates from August 2020,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Jump Roping,Прыгать на скакалке,"0.022,0.0188,0.026,0.022,0.0244,0.0292,0.0212,0.0308,0.0188,0.0396,0.4257,0.0196,0.0396,0.018,0.0244,0.0228,0.0627,0.0819,0.022,0.0308",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7210681/pexels-photo-7210681.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
236,astronomy,Astronomy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy,"Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία, literally meaning the science that studies the laws of the stars) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.
Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Greek-language text,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018,Astronomy,CS1 maint: location,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Good articles,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Physical sciences,Short description is different from Wikidata,Solar System,Use dmy dates from April 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Astronomy,Астрономия,"0.0255,0.015,0.0175,0.5952,0.0157,0.0157,0.0138,0.02,0.0175,0.02,0.0163,0.0206,0.085,0.0169,0.02,0.0163,0.015,0.0218,0.0144,0.0181",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1624496/pexels-photo-1624496.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
237,rock climbing,Rock climbing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing,"Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.
Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, such as scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, differentiated by rock climbing's sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.
Professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Indoor rock climbing is typically split into three disciplines. These disciplines are bouldering, lead climbing, and top roping.","All articles with minor POV problems,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles with minor POV problems from August 2014,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2015,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),Rock climbing,Short description is different from Wikidata,Types of climbing,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2015",Rock climbing,Скалолазание,"0.0322,0.0346,0.0237,0.0493,0.0354,0.0455,0.0408,0.0447,0.0532,0.0322,0.2754,0.033,0.0501,0.0221,0.0478,0.0322,0.0322,0.0455,0.026,0.0439",https://images.pexels.com/photos/673018/pexels-photo-673018.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

This technique is used by climbers, mountaineers, cavers, canyoners, search and rescue and rope access technicians to descend cliffs or slopes when they are too steep and/or dangerous to descend without protection. Many climbers use this technique to protect established anchors from damage. Rope access technicians also use this as a method to access difficult-to-reach areas from above for various industrial applications like maintenance, construction, inspection and welding.To descend safely, abseilers use a variety of techniques to increase the friction on the rope to the point where it can be controlled comfortably. These techniques range from wrapping the rope around their body (e.g. The Dülfersitz) to using a custom built device like a rack. Practitioners choose a technique based on speed, safety, weight and other circumstantial concerns.
In the United States, the term ""rappelling"" is used nearly exclusively. In the United Kingdom, both terms are understood, but ""abseiling"" is strongly preferred. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the two terms are used interchangeably. Globally, the term ""rappelling"" appears in books written in English more often than ""abseiling"".","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing POV-check from February 2019,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2019,Caving techniques,Climbing techniques,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Mountaineering techniques,Short description matches Wikidata,Types of climbing,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Rappelling,Дюльфер,"0.0167,0.03,0.0441,0.0307,0.0426,0.0322,0.0211,0.0448,0.0285,0.0322,0.1004,0.0433,0.0241,0.027,0.0181,0.027,0.3678,0.0181,0.0285,0.0226",https://images.pexels.com/photos/97805/pexels-photo-97805.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word ""theatre"" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, ""a place for viewing""), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, ""to see"", ""to watch"", ""to observe"").
Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general.Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging.

240,drawing,Drawing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing,"Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices.
A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.
In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.","Articles with Project Gutenberg links,Articles with short description,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons category link from Wikidata,Drawing,Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from December 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Drawing,Графический рисунок,"0.0193,0.0397,0.0285,0.0306,0.0707,0.0243,0.0158,0.0193,0.0278,0.0172,0.02,0.0236,0.0207,0.0179,0.5214,0.0313,0.0172,0.0158,0.0172,0.0214",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3778177/pexels-photo-3778177.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
241,rafting,Rafting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafting,"Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk  is often a part of the experience.This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.

244,foreign language learning,Computer-assisted language learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_language_learning,"Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), British, or Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI)/Computer-Aided Language Instruction (CALI), American, is briefly defined in a seminal work by Levy (1997: p. 1) as ""the search for and study of applications of the computer in language teaching and learning"". CALL embraces a wide range of information and communications technology applications and approaches to teaching and learning foreign languages, from the ""traditional"" drill-and-practice programs that characterised CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent manifestations of CALL, e.g. as used in a virtual learning environment and Web-based distance learning. It also extends to the use of corpora and concordancers, interactive whiteboards, computer-mediated communication (CMC), language learning in virtual worlds, and mobile-assisted language learning (MALL).The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was in use before CALL, reflecting its origins as a subset of the general term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it appeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language teachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on learning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s (Davies & Higgins 1982: p. 3) and it is now incorporated into the names of the growing number of professional associations worldwide.
An alternative term, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL), also emerged around the early 1990s: e.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.
The current philosophy of CALL puts a strong emphasis on student-centred materials that allow learners to work on their own. Such materials may be structured or unstructured, but they normally embody two important features: interactive learning and individualised learning. CALL is essentially a tool that helps teachers to facilitate the language learning process. It can be used to reinforce what has already been learned in the classroom or as a remedial tool to help learners who require additional support.
The design of CALL materials generally takes into consideration principles of language pedagogy and methodology, which may be derived from different learning theories (e.g. behaviourist, cognitive, constructivist) and second-language learning theories such as Stephen Krashen's monitor hypothesis.
A combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as blended learning. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential and is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p. 27).See Davies et al. (2011: Section 1.1, What is CALL?).

245,foraging,Foraging,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging,"Foraging is searching for wild food resources. It affects an animal's fitness because it plays an important role in an animal's ability to survive and reproduce. Foraging theory is a branch of behavioral ecology that studies the foraging behavior of animals in response to the environment where the animal lives.
Behavioral ecologists use economic models to understand foraging; many of these models are a type of optimal model. Thus foraging theory is discussed in terms of optimizing a payoff from a foraging decision.  The payoff for many of these models is the amount of energy an animal receives per unit time, more specifically, the highest ratio of energetic gain to cost while foraging.  Foraging theory predicts that the decisions that maximize energy per unit time and thus deliver the highest payoff will be selected for and persist. Key words used to describe foraging behavior include resources, the elements necessary for survival and reproduction which have a limited supply, predator, any organism that consumes others, prey, an organism that is eaten in part or whole by another, and patches, concentrations of resources.
Behavioral ecologists first tackled this topic in the 1960s and 1970s. Their goal was to quantify and formalize a set of models to test their null hypothesis that animals forage randomly. Important contributions to foraging theory have been made by:

Eric Charnov, who developed the marginal value theorem to predict the behavior of foragers using patches;
Sir John Krebs, with work on the optimal diet model in relation to tits and chickadees;
John Goss-Custard, who first tested the optimal diet model against behavior in the field, using redshank, and then proceeded to an extensive study of foraging in the common pied oystercatcher

246,wargames,WarGames,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame,"A wargame is a game that realistically simulates warfare, as opposed to abstract strategy games such as chess. Wargaming may be played for recreation, to train military officers in the art of strategic thinking, or to study the nature of potential conflicts. Many wargames recreate specific historic battles, and can cover either whole wars, or any campaigns, battles, or lower-level engagements within them. Many simulate land combat, but there are wargames for naval and air combat as well.
Generally, events based on live action (people actually performing simulated combat activities) are not considered wargames. Some writers may refer to a military's field training exercises as ""live wargames"", but certain institutions such as the US Navy do not accept this.  Likewise, activities like paintball are sports rather than wargames.
Modern wargaming was invented in Prussia around the turn of the 19th-century, and eventually the Prussian military adopted wargames as a way of training their officers and developing doctrine. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, wargaming was widely adopted by military officers in other countries. Civilian enthusiasts also played wargames for fun, but this was a niche hobby until the development of consumer electronic wargames in the 1990s.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from December 2014,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from January 2012,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2009,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2011,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2020,CS1 German-language sources (de),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Military historiography,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Short description is different from Wikidata,Wargames,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Wargames,Военные игры,"0.0385,0.0313,0.021,0.0361,0.0361,0.0337,0.3536,0.052,0.0313,0.0274,0.0321,0.0218,0.0425,0.0425,0.0179,0.0179,0.0321,0.0726,0.0345,0.025",https://unsplash.com/photos/-_02VOYclsY/download

The in-line design allows for greater speed and maneuverability than traditional (or ""quad"") roller skates. Following this basic design principle, inline skates can be modified to varying degrees to accommodate niche disciplines.
Inline skating is commonly referred to by the proprietary eponym ""rollerblading"", or just ""blading"", due to the popular brand of inline skates, Rollerblade.

Tesla used these circuits to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today, their main usage is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used as leak detectors for high vacuum systems.","19th-century inventions,All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify,All articles needing additional references,All pages needing cleanup,Articles containing how-to sections,Articles containing video clips,Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from September 2020,Articles needing additional references from August 2015,Articles needing cleanup from June 2018,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 errors: missing periodical,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Electric transformers,Electrical breakdown,Inventions by Nikola Tesla,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Power supplies,Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template other archives,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers,Wikipedia introduction cleanup from September 2020",Tesla Coils,Трансформатор Теслы,"0.0268,0.0268,0.326,0.0327,0.0268,0.0736,0.0268,0.0317,0.0346,0.058,0.0249,0.0648,0.0327,0.0278,0.0239,0.0375,0.0346,0.0219,0.0463,0.0219",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4226765/pexels-photo-4226765.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
252,software cracking,Software cracking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking,"Software cracking (known as ""breaking"" mostly in the 1980s) is the modification of software to remove or disable features which are considered undesirable by the person cracking the software, especially copy protection features (including protection against the manipulation of software, serial number, hardware key, date checks and disc check) or software annoyances like nag screens and adware.
A crack refers to the means of achieving, for example a stolen serial number or a tool that performs that act of cracking. Some of these tools are called keygen, patch, or loader. A keygen is a handmade product serial number generator that often offers the ability to generate working serial numbers in your own name. A patch is a small computer program that modifies the machine code of another program. This has the advantage for a cracker to not include a large executable in a release when only a few bytes are changed. A loader modifies the startup flow of a program and does not remove the protection but circumvents it. A well-known example of a loader is a trainer used to cheat in games. Fairlight pointed out in one of their .nfo files that these type of cracks are not allowed for warez scene game releases. A nukewar has shown that the protection may not kick in at any point for it to be a valid crack.The distribution of cracked copies is illegal in most countries. There have been lawsuits over cracking software. It might be legal to use cracked software in certain circumstances. Educational resources for reverse engineering and software cracking are, however, legal and available in the form of Crackme programs.

253,electronic music,Electronic music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music,"Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments, or circuitry-based music technology in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depended entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer. Electromechanical instruments can have mechanical parts such as strings, hammers, and electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and the electric guitar.The first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, a number of electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s, in Egypt and France. Musique concrète, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and Algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.
During the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and Japanese drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop and EDM. In the early 1980s mass produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture.  Contemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.","19th-century music genres,19th century in music,20th-century music genres,20th century in music,21st-century music genres,21st century in music,Accuracy disputes from December 2011,All Wikipedia articles needing clarification,All accuracy disputes,All articles with failed verification,All articles with incomplete citations,All articles with unsourced statements,All pages needing factual verification,Articles containing French-language text,Articles with failed verification from April 2021,Articles with failed verification from December 2011,Articles with incomplete citations from June 2011,Articles with incomplete citations from March 2021,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2018,Audio engineering,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja),CS1 Swedish-language sources (sv),CS1 uses Japanese-language script (ja),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Electronic music,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Musical improvisation,New media,Pages containing links to subscription-only content,Popular music,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sound,Sound effects,Symphonies,Use dmy dates from March 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2020,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2012,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2018,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from October 2014,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from June 2011,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from April 2014,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from October 2012,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers",Electronic music,Электронная музыка,"0.0139,0.0721,0.0844,0.0154,0.0225,0.0229,0.0139,0.0177,0.491,0.0239,0.0144,0.0154,0.0622,0.0125,0.0116,0.0144,0.0305,0.013,0.0333,0.0149",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3642350/pexels-photo-3642350.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Beads come in a variety of materials, shapes and sizes. Beads are used to create jewelry or other articles of personal adornment; they are also used in wall hangings and sculpture and many other artworks.
Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into loom and off-loom weaving, stringing, bead embroidery, bead crochet, bead knitting, and bead tatting.Beads, made of durable materials, survive in the archaeological record appearing with the very advent of modern man, Homo sapiens.Beads are used for religious purposes, as good luck talismans, for barter, and as curative or medicinal agents.

255,cigar smoking,Cigar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car,"A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex, but also more reliable and easier to operate. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries.","19th-century inventions,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles to be expanded,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2019,Articles lacking reliable references from June 2019,Articles to be expanded from March 2019,Articles to be expanded from November 2019,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2020,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,Cars,Commons category link is on Wikidata,German inventions,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from September 2014,Wheeled vehicles,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism",Cigar Smoking,Курение сигар,"0.034,0.0687,0.0222,0.0217,0.02,0.0191,0.0195,0.1842,0.0248,0.0213,0.0195,0.2751,0.0296,0.0253,0.0169,0.0441,0.0231,0.0121,0.0608,0.0578",https://images.pexels.com/photos/247040/pexels-photo-247040.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

257,cryptography,Cryptography,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography,"Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós ""hidden, secret""; and γράφειν graphein, ""to write"", or -λογία -logia, ""study"", respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.
Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting information from a readable state to unintelligible nonsense. The sender of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice (""A"") for the sender, Bob (""B"") for the intended recipient, and Eve (""eavesdropper"") for the adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and its applications more varied.
Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed ""computationally secure""; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated, and if necessary, adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, but these schemes are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.
The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the information age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes in regard to digital media.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with broken links to citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Applied mathematics,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles needing additional references from March 2021,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2013,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2020,Banking technology,CS1: long volume value,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Cryptography,Formal sciences,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from September 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from December 2018,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia pending changes protected pages",Cryptography,Криптография,"0.1649,0.056,0.0595,0.1026,0.2525,0.0412,0.0381,0.0163,0.0272,0.0237,0.0142,0.0259,0.0194,0.0107,0.0133,0.0198,0.0407,0.0233,0.0146,0.0359",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7319084/pexels-photo-7319084.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

260,psychology,Psychology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology,"Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feelings and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists also seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As a social science, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. Some psychologists can also be classified as social, behavioral, or cognitive scientists. Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. Others explore the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.
Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. Psychologists also consider the unconscious mind. Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation.
While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, hospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings. Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensics, and the media.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2021,Behavioural sciences,CS1: long volume value,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 errors: missing title,Cognitive behavioral therapy,Psychology,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from May 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from February 2019,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Psychology,Психология,"0.241,0.0168,0.0353,0.3746,0.0423,0.0163,0.0223,0.0198,0.0163,0.0213,0.0173,0.0218,0.0128,0.0288,0.0253,0.0268,0.0138,0.0128,0.0153,0.0198",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8458997/pexels-photo-8458997.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity and will have five components: warm-up (5–10 minutes), cardiovascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer different types of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.

There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as: the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it and the funds available to build it.
The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones. The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland. The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.

Debates have historically occurred in public meetings, academic institutions, debate halls, coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies. It is a formal type of discussion, and often includes a moderator along with an audience.
Logical consistency, factual accuracy, and some degree of emotional appeal to the audience are elements in debating, where one side often prevails over the other party by presenting a superior ""position"" on the issue. Modern debating contests include rules for participants to discuss and decide upon the framework of the debate (how the debate will be judged).
Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies, a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected offices such as the leaders' debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies.","All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles needing additional references,All articles needing examples,All articles needing rewrite,All articles that may contain original research,All articles to be expanded,All articles with minor POV problems,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with style issues,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles contradicting other articles,Articles lacking in-text citations from January 2009,Articles needing additional references from August 2015,Articles needing additional references from January 2009,Articles needing examples from August 2015,Articles that may contain original research from January 2015,Articles to be expanded from April 2012,Articles to be expanded from August 2015,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with minor POV problems from August 2015,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from August 2015,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from September 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2011,Articles with weasel words from January 2015,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Debating,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from August 2015,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2019,Wikipedia articles needing rewrite from December 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from January 2015",Debate,Дебаты,"0.0806,0.0419,0.0276,0.0541,0.0168,0.0441,0.3452,0.0219,0.0197,0.0176,0.0484,0.0226,0.0276,0.0233,0.0247,0.0348,0.0398,0.0348,0.0211,0.0534",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8847170/pexels-photo-8847170.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

270,fly tying,Fly tying,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_tying,"Fly tying (also historically referred to in England as dressing flies) is the process of producing an artificial fly used by fly fishing anglers to catch fish. Fly tying is a manual process done by a single individual using hand tools and a variety of natural and manmade materials that are attached to a hook.  Although the recent history of fly tying dates from the middle 1800s, fly tyers were engaged in tying flys since at least 200 AD.      
Helen Shaw, an American professional fly tyer, defined fly tying as the ""simple process of binding various materials to a hook with thread"".  Fly tying is a practical art form that many individuals are able to practice with reasonable success and tie flies which produce results when fly fishing.  It is also a hobby that benefits from the fly tyer's knowledge of the insects and other food sources that fish consume in the wild.Fly tying requires some basic equipment; a vise to hold the hook, a bobbin to dispense and provide tension on thread, scissors, pliers and the appropriate materials for the particular fly pattern selected. These materials consists mostly of feathers, hackle, fur/animal hairs, threads, and various synthetic materials. 
Fly tying equipment enables the fly tyer to efficiently and effectively assemble and secure the materials on the hook to produce a particular type of fly. Fly tying materials were originally limited to various furs, feathers, threads and hooks. Since the mid-1900s, many more natural and synthetic materials are available to use to tie flies.Fly patterns are the instructions or recipes required to create the fly. They specify hook sizes and types, the materials and colors to be used, as well as the sequence to be followed and the assembly methods. There are thousands of possible fly patterns available to the tyer.","CS1 maint: date and year,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,Commons category link from Wikidata,Fishing equipment,Fly fishing,Handicrafts",Fly Tying,Вязание мушек,"0.0443,0.0205,0.0304,0.0194,0.0923,0.0217,0.024,0.0205,0.0142,0.042,0.0217,0.2815,0.0373,0.0448,0.1357,0.0541,0.042,0.0142,0.0217,0.0177",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5273711/pexels-photo-5273711.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the ""Year of Intelligence"", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee's efforts led to the establishment of the permanent U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
The most shocking revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA involving the drugging and torture of unwitting US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control; COINTELPRO involving the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations; Family Jewels, a CIA program to covertly assassinate foreign leaders; Operation Mockingbird as a systematic propaganda campaign with domestic and foreign journalists operating as CIA assets and dozens of US news organizations providing cover for CIA activity.Anticipating the 2013 Global surveillance disclosures by Snowden, it also unearthed Project SHAMROCK in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA.

274,poker,Poker,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker,"Poker is any of a number of card games in which players wager over which hand is best according to that specific game's rules in ways similar to these rankings. Often using a standard deck, poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number dealt face up or face down, and the number shared by all players, but all have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.
In most modern poker games, the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the blind or ante). In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or ""call"") the maximum previous bet, or fold, losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also ""raise"" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.
With the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability, psychology, and game theory.
Poker has increased in popularity since the beginning of the 20th century and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.","19th-century card games,American inventions,Anglo-American card games,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Gambling games,Games of mental skill,Multiplayer games,Poker,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia pending changes protected pages",Poker,Покер,"0.033,0.0486,0.0132,0.0309,0.0191,0.0158,0.2837,0.0298,0.0137,0.0486,0.0196,0.0132,0.0228,0.0357,0.0416,0.0276,0.0266,0.2107,0.018,0.048",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6664182/pexels-photo-6664182.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

276,bonsai tree,Bonsai,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai,"Bonsai (Japanese: 盆栽, lit. 'tray planting', pronounced [boɰ̃sai] (listen)) is a Japanese version of the original traditional Chinese art penjing or penzai. Unlike penjing, which utilizes traditional techniques to produce entire natural sceneries in small pots that mimic the grandiose and shape of real life sceneries, the Japanese ""bonsai"" only attempts to produce small trees that mimic the shape of real life trees. Similar versions of the art exist in other cultures, including the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese Hòn non bộ. It was during the Tang dynasty, when penjing was at its height, that the art was first introduced into Japan. 
The loanword ""bonsai"" (a Japanese pronunciation of the original Chinese term penzai) has become an umbrella term in English, attached to many forms of potted or other plants, and also on occasion to other living and non-living things. According to Stephen Orr in The New York Times, ""the term should be reserved for plants that are grown in shallow containers following the precise tenets of bonsai pruning and training, resulting in an artful miniature replica of a full-grown tree in nature."" In the most restrictive sense, ""bonsai"" refers to miniaturized, container-grown trees adhering to Japanese tradition and principles.
Purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation for the viewer, and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity for the grower.  By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for medicine. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a container.
A bonsai is created beginning with a specimen of source material. This may be a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai.
The source specimen is shaped to be relatively small and to meet the aesthetic standards of bonsai, which emphasizes not the entirety of grand sceneries but rather only the tree itself. When the candidate bonsai nears its planned final size, it is planted in a display pot, usually one designed for bonsai display in one of a few accepted shapes and proportions. From that point forward, its growth is restricted by the pot environment. Throughout the year, the bonsai is shaped to limit growth, redistribute foliar vigor to areas requiring further development, and meet the artist's detailed design.
The practice of bonsai is sometimes confused with dwarfing, but dwarfing generally refers to research, discovery, or creation of plants that are permanent, genetic miniatures of existing species. Plant dwarfing often uses selective breeding or genetic engineering to create dwarf cultivars. Bonsai does not require genetically dwarfed trees but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-size trees.","All articles with failed verification,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles containing Korean-language text,Articles containing Vietnamese-language text,Articles with failed verification from September 2016,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with hCards,Articles with short description,Bonsai,Horticulture and gardening,Short description is different from Wikidata,Trees,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Bonsai Tree,Бонсай,"0.0241,0.0314,0.0111,0.0496,0.1629,0.018,0.0143,0.0154,0.0234,0.0256,0.0093,0.047,0.0151,0.4011,0.026,0.0416,0.0198,0.0103,0.0238,0.0303",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6045734/pexels-photo-6045734.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
277,mountain biking,Mountain biking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking,"Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tyres, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as ""Enduro""), downhill, and freeride.This sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, wider bike park trails, fire roads, and some advanced trails are designed with jumps, berms, and drop-offs to add excitement to the trail.  Riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the summer to ride downhill-specific trails, using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes. Because riders are often far from civilization, there is a strong element of self-reliance in the sport. Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded. Many riders carry a backpack, including water, food, tools for trailside repairs, and a first aid kit in case of injury. Group rides are common, especially on longer treks. Mountain bike orienteering adds the skill of map navigation to mountain biking.","Adventure travel,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with failed verification,All articles with style issues,Articles lacking reliable references from November 2013,Articles needing additional references from February 2016,Articles with dead external links from April 2020,Articles with failed verification from July 2020,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,CS1: long volume value,CS1 errors: URL,CS1 errors: missing periodical,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Cycle sport,Mountain biking,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from February 2016",Mountain Biking,Катание на горных велосипедах,"0.0292,0.0175,0.0175,0.0236,0.0325,0.0714,0.0208,0.2675,0.0169,0.0325,0.1047,0.0919,0.0336,0.0142,0.0214,0.0242,0.0792,0.0214,0.0358,0.0442",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1010547/pexels-photo-1010547.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The most recognizable form of juggling is toss juggling. Juggling can be the manipulation of one object or many objects at the same time, most often using one or two hands but also possible with feet. Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props. The most common props are balls, clubs, or rings. Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as knives, fire torches or chainsaws. The term juggling can also commonly refer to other prop-based manipulation skills, such as diabolo, plate spinning, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, contact juggling, hooping, yo-yo, and hat manipulation.","All articles with incomplete citations,Articles containing video clips,Articles prone to spam from March 2012,Articles with incomplete citations from March 2014,Articles with short description,Ball games,Circus skills,Commons link is on Wikidata,Juggling,Short description is different from Wikidata,Street performance,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Juggling,Жонглирование,"0.0289,0.0387,0.0289,0.0245,0.0245,0.1977,0.0757,0.0321,0.0256,0.0408,0.0452,0.0321,0.1269,0.0289,0.0398,0.0321,0.043,0.0659,0.0441,0.0245",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6764100/pexels-photo-6764100.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
281,speed skating,Speed skating,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating,"Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in travelling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. In the Olympic Games, long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just ""speed skating"", while short-track speed skating is known as ""short track"". The International Skating Union (ISU), the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as ""speed skating"" and short track as ""short track skating"".
An international federation was founded in 1892, the first for any winter sport. The sport enjoys large popularity in the Netherlands, Norway and South Korea. There are top international rinks in a number of other countries, including Canada, the United States, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Belarus and Poland. A World Cup circuit is held with events in those countries plus two events in the Thialf ice hall in Heerenveen, Netherlands.

282,breakdancing,Breakdancing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing,"Breakdancing, also called breaking or b-boying/b-girling, is an athletic style of street dance from the United States. While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, breakdancing mainly consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves and freezes. Breakdancing is typically set to songs containing drum breaks, especially in hip-hop, funk, soul music and breakbeat music, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns.
Breakdancing was created by the African American and Puerto Rican youth in the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, the dance had begun to spread to other communities and was gaining wider popularity; at the same time, the dance had peaked in popularity among African Americans and Puerto Ricans.A practitioner of this dance is called a b-boy, b-girl, breakdancer, or breaker. Although the term ""breakdance"" is frequently used to refer to the dance in popular culture and in the mainstream entertainment industry, ""b-boying"" and ""breaking"" were the original terms and are preferred by the majority of the pioneers and most notable practitioners.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with self-published sources,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from February 2021,Articles needing additional references from November 2007,Articles with dead external links from October 2016,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with self-published sources from July 2021,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2021,Breakdance,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 French-language sources (fr),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Hip hop dance,Short description matches Wikidata,Street dance,Use mdy dates from July 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Breakdancing,Брейк-данс,"0.0255,0.0263,0.0238,0.028,0.0489,0.3145,0.0297,0.0196,0.099,0.0338,0.0422,0.023,0.053,0.0355,0.0547,0.0447,0.0313,0.0213,0.0188,0.0263",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5385727/pexels-photo-5385727.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The primary knots of macramé are the square (or reef knot) and forms of ""hitching"": various combinations of half hitches. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to cover anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.
Cavandoli macramé is one variety that is used to form geometric and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Reverse half hitches are sometimes used to maintain balance when working left and right halves of a balanced piece.
Leather or fabric belts are another accessory often created via macramé techniques.  Most friendship bracelets exchanged among schoolchildren and teens are created using this method. Vendors at theme parks, malls, seasonal fairs and other public places may sell macramé jewelry or decoration as well.","1970s fads and trends,Articles containing Arabic-language text,Articles with short description,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Decorative ropework,Lace,Mexican crafts,Short description matches Wikidata,Visual arts,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Macrame,Макраме,"0.0209,0.0449,0.0491,0.0286,0.0389,0.2209,0.0312,0.0397,0.0235,0.0295,0.0321,0.0192,0.0321,0.0303,0.1474,0.044,0.0791,0.0244,0.0372,0.0269",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7190406/pexels-photo-7190406.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Sweepstakes began as a form of lottery that were tied to products sold. In response, the FCC and FTC refined U.S. broadcasting laws (creating the anti-lottery laws). Under these laws sweepstakes became strictly ""No purchase necessary to enter or win"" and ""A purchase will not increase your chances of winning"", especially since many sweepstakes companies skirted the law by stating only ""no purchase necessary to enter"", removing the consideration (one of the three legally required elements of gambling) to stop abuse of sweepstakes. Today, sweepstakes in the USA are used as marketing promotions to reward existing consumers and to draw attention to a product. By definition, the winner is determined by luck rather than skill.

286,dj,Disc jockey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey,"A disc jockey, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays recorded music for an audience. Most common types of DJs include: radio DJs, club DJs (who work at a nightclub or music festival), mobile DJs (who are hired to work at public and private events such as weddings, parties, or festivals), and turntablists (who use record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records). Originally, the ""disc"" in ""disc jockey"" referred to shellac and later vinyl records, but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who mix music from other recording media such as cassettes, CDs or digital audio files on a CDJ, controller, or even a laptop. DJs may adopt the title ""DJ"" in front of their real names, adopted pseudonyms, or stage names.
DJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and mix them together to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves aligning the beats of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized DJ mixers, small audio mixers with crossfader and cue functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in headphones and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a DJ controller device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a microphone to speak to the audience; effects units such as reverb to create sound effects and electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.

charisma, plural: χαρίσματα charismata) is a concept in extraordinary power given by the Holy Spirit. These are believed by followers to be supernatural graces which individual Christians need (and needed in the days of the Apostles) to fulfill the mission of the Church. In the narrowest sense, it is a theological term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others and is distinguished from the graces given for personal sanctification, such as the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.These abilities, often termed ""charismatic gifts"", are the, the word of knowledge, increased faith, the gifts of healing, the gift of miracles, prophecy, the discernment of spirits, diverse kinds of tongues, interpretation of tongues. To these are added the gifts of apostles, prophets, teachers, helps (connected to service of the poor and sick), and governments (or leadership ability) which are connected with certain offices in the Church. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to individuals, but their purpose is to build up the entire Church. They are described in the New Testament, primarily in 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4. 1 Peter 4 also touches on the spiritual gifts.The gifts are related to both seemingly ""natural"" abilities and seemingly more ""miraculous"" abilities, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The two major opposing theological positions on their nature is that they ceased long ago or that they continue (Cessationism versus Continuationism).

288,cave diving,Cave diving,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_diving,"Cave diving is underwater diving in water-filled caves. It may be done as an extreme sport, a way of exploring flooded caves for scientific investigation, or for the search for and recovery of divers lost while diving for one of these reasons. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, and ranges from breath hold to surface supplied, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops.
In the United Kingdom, cave diving developed from the locally more common activity of caving. Its origins in the United States are more closely associated to recreational scuba diving. Compared to caving and scuba diving, there are relatively few practitioners of cave diving. This is due in part to the specialized equipment and skill sets required, and in part because of the high potential risks due to the specific environment.
Despite these risks, water-filled caves attract scuba divers, cavers, and speleologists due to their often unexplored nature, and present divers with a technical diving challenge. Underwater caves have a wide range of physical features, and can contain fauna not found elsewhere.","All articles needing additional references,All articles to be expanded,All articles with empty sections,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Articles needing additional references from April 2016,Articles to be expanded from August 2020,Articles to be expanded from October 2019,Articles to be expanded from September 2017,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with empty sections from September 2017,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2013,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2012,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2012,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2012,CS1: long volume value,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),CS1 Finnish-language sources (fi),CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no),Cave diving,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from September 2020,Vague or ambiguous time from April 2016,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2013,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from December 2016,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Cave Diving,Пещерный дайвинг,"0.0419,0.0183,0.0183,0.0341,0.0197,0.0254,0.0369,0.0384,0.0183,0.4297,0.0599,0.0197,0.0384,0.0219,0.0211,0.0247,0.0541,0.0269,0.0305,0.0219",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8849951/pexels-photo-8849951.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
289,amateur radio,Amateur radio,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio,"Amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is the use of radio frequency spectrum for purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, private recreation, radiosport, contesting, and emergency communication. The term ""amateur"" is used to specify ""a duly authorised person interested in radioelectric practice with a purely personal aim and without pecuniary interest;"" (either direct monetary or other similar reward) and to differentiate it from commercial broadcasting, public safety (such as police and fire), or professional two-way radio services (such as maritime, aviation, taxis, etc.).
The amateur radio service (amateur service and amateur-satellite service) is established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) through the Radio Regulations. National governments regulate technical and operational characteristics of transmissions and issue individual station licenses with a unique identifying call sign, which must be used in all transmissions.  Amateur operators must hold an amateur radio license which is obtained by passing a government test demonstrating adequate technical radio knowledge and legal knowledge of the host government's radio regulations.   
Radio amateurs are limited to the use of small frequency bands, the amateur radio bands, allocated throughout the radio spectrum, but within these bands are allowed to transmit on any frequency using a variety of voice, text, image, and data communications modes.  This enables communication across a city, region, country, continent, the world, or even into space. In many countries, amateur radio operators may also send, receive, or relay radio communications between computers or transceivers connected to secure virtual private networks on the Internet.
Amateur radio is officially represented and coordinated by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU), which is organized in three regions and has as its members the national amateur radio societies which exist in most countries. According to an estimate made in 2011 by the American Radio Relay League, two million people throughout the world are regularly involved with amateur radio. About 830,000 amateur radio stations are located in IARU Region 2 (the Americas) followed by IARU Region 3 (South and East Asia and the Pacific Ocean) with about 750,000 stations. A significantly smaller number, about 400,000, are located in IARU Region 1 (Europe, Middle East, CIS, Africa).","All articles with unsourced statements,Amateur radio,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2013,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),Commons category link is on Wikidata,History of radio,Radiocommunication services ITU,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from November 2019,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Amateur Radio,Любительское радио,"0.1077,0.0854,0.0205,0.0864,0.0236,0.0164,0.0392,0.0345,0.0304,0.0283,0.0241,0.0164,0.0241,0.019,0.0319,0.0569,0.0215,0.0262,0.251,0.0563",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3620411/pexels-photo-3620411.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

An antique is usually an item that is collected or desirable because of its age, beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human history.

A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and sometimes a pen or pencil. The geocacher signs the log with their established code name and dates it, in order to prove that they found the cache. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it.  Larger containers such as plastic storage containers (Tupperware or similar) or ammunition boxes can also contain items for trading, such as toys or trinkets, usually of more sentimental worth than financial.

Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with former Formula One champions such as Sebastian Vettel, Nico Rosberg, Ayrton Senna, Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso having begun their careers in karting.
Karts vary widely in speed and some (known as superkarts) can reach speeds exceeding 161 kilometres per hour (100 mph), while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.

300,stocks,Stocks,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock,"Stock (also capital stock) is all of the shares into which ownership of a corporation is divided. In American English, the shares are collectively known as ""stock"". A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the stockholder to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested.  Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.
Stock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price.  Stock options, issued by many companies as part of employee compensation, do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price.  This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes).","All articles needing additional references,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,Articles needing additional references from January 2018,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from May 2016,CS1 errors: requires URL,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons category link is locally defined,Corporate finance,Equity securities,Short description is different from Wikidata,Stock market,Use dmy dates from December 2020,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from September 2013,Wikipedia articles with BNC identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages",Stocks,Акции,"0.0164,0.2309,0.0302,0.0152,0.0188,0.0248,0.0152,0.0326,0.0158,0.0266,0.0326,0.0164,0.026,0.0152,0.017,0.333,0.0158,0.0146,0.0296,0.0732",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8369772/pexels-photo-8369772.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
301,handwriting analysis,Graphology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology,"Graphology is the analysis of the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting with attempt to identify the writer, indicate the psychological state at the time of writing, or evaluate personality characteristics. No scientific evidence exists to support graphology, and it is generally considered a pseudoscience or scientifically questionably practice. However, it remains in widespread use in France and has historically been considered legitimate for use in some court cases. The term is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to forensic document examination, due to the fact that aspects of the latter dealing with the examination of handwritten documents are occasionally referred to as graphanalysis.
Schlicht, an academic historian, states that while graphology failed to become a scientific discipline, many experts in experimental psychology and psychiatry participated in the endeavour to study graphology within a broader, more recognized science of expression, and that ""to qualify something as pseudoscience can thus easily result in an unsystematic examination of a historical constellation of knowledge production."" Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters. It has also been rated by mental health professionals as one of the top five most discredited psychological tests.

303,hiking,Hiking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling,"Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"", ""bicyclists"", or ""bikers"". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.
Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.
Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion. These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles. Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery. Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles, often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.","Aerobic exercise,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking reliable references from November 2010,Articles prone to spam from June 2012,Articles with dead external links from July 2019,Articles with dead external links from September 2019,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015,Cycling,Emissions reduction,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sustainable transport,Symbols of Illinois,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from March 2015,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Hiking,Хайкинг,"0.0138,0.0109,0.0109,0.0128,0.0109,0.0118,0.0114,0.778,0.0109,0.0114,0.0133,0.0118,0.0118,0.0109,0.0114,0.0114,0.0109,0.0128,0.0114,0.0118",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5993936/pexels-photo-5993936.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

It is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in flying disc games. The shape of the disc is an airfoil in cross-section which allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air. Spinning the disc imparts a stabilizing gyroscopic force, allowing it to be both aimed with accuracy and thrown for distance.
A wide range is available of flying disc variants. Those for disc golf are usually smaller but denser and tailored for particular flight profiles to increase or decrease stability and distance. The longest recorded disc throw is by David Wiggins Jr. with a distance of 1,109 feet (338 m). Disc dog sports use relatively slow-flying discs made of more pliable material to better resist a dog's bite and prevent injury to the dog. Flying rings are also available which typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc. Illuminated discs are made of phosphorescent plastic or contain chemiluminescent fluid or battery-powered LEDs for play after dark. Others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight.
The term frisbee is often used generically to describe all flying discs, but Frisbee is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company. This protection results in organized sports such as ultimate or disc golf having to forgo use of the word ""Frisbee"".

Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing.
Another aspect of skimboarding is ""flatland,"" which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that were too fast and shallow for surfboards. Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave. Professionals have even started getting towed by waverunners into much larger waves.","All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles needing additional references,All articles to be expanded,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking in-text citations from August 2013,Articles needing additional references from May 2016,Articles prone to spam from August 2013,Articles to be expanded from August 2013,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Boardsports,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Skimboarding,Water sports,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2016",Skimboarding,Скимбординг,"0.0223,0.0184,0.02,0.0301,0.0184,0.1639,0.0293,0.0239,0.027,0.0614,0.2516,0.0254,0.0309,0.02,0.0622,0.0732,0.0333,0.0192,0.0434,0.0262",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3141261/pexels-photo-3141261.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
308,running,Running,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running,"Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.
Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.

310,snowmobiles,Snowmobile,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowmobile,"A snowmobile, also known as a motor sled, motor sledge, skimobile, snow scooter, Ski-Doo, or snowmachine, is a motorized vehicle designed for winter travel and recreation on snow. It is designed to be operated on snow and ice and does not require a road or trail, but most are driven on open terrain or trails. Snowmobiling is a sport that many people have taken on as a serious hobby.
Older snowmobiles could generally accommodate two people; however, most snowmobiles manufactured since the 1990s have been designed to only accommodate one person. Snowmobiles built with the ability to accommodate two people are referred to as ""2-up"" snowmobiles or ""touring"" models and make up an extremely small share of the market. Snowmobiles do not have any enclosures, except for a windshield, and their engines normally drive a continuous track at the rear. Skis at the front provide directional control.
Early snowmobiles used simple rubber tracks, but modern snowmobiles' tracks are usually made of a Kevlar composite construction. Originally, snowmobiles were powered by two-stroke gasoline internal combustion engines and since the mid-2000s four-stroke engines have also entered the market.
The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of recreational snowmobiling, whose riders are called snowmobilers or sledders. Recreational riding is known as snowcross/racing, trail riding, freestyle, boondocking, ditchbanging and grass drags. In the summertime snowmobilers can drag race on grass, asphalt strips, or even across water (see Snowmobile skipping).  Snowmobiles are sometimes modified to compete in long-distance off-road races.","All Wikipedia articles in need of updating,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2003,Articles containing video clips,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2007,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2011,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2013,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 Norwegian-language sources (no),Canadian inventions,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Inuit transport,Racing vehicles,Short description matches Wikidata,Sliding vehicles,Snowmobiles,Tracked vehicles,Vague or ambiguous time from December 2011,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles in need of updating from August 2020,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Snowmobiles,Снегоходы,"0.0179,0.0263,0.0283,0.0146,0.0198,0.0198,0.0289,0.1537,0.0172,0.0322,0.0861,0.3772,0.0166,0.0224,0.0231,0.0198,0.0302,0.0244,0.0179,0.0237",https://images.pexels.com/photos/91216/pexels-photo-91216.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
311,weaving,Weaving,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving,"Weaving is a method of textile production  in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft, woof, or filling. (Weft is an old English word meaning ""that which is woven""; compare leave and left.) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.
Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band that meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back strap loom, or other techniques that can be done without looms.The way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave.  The majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves: plain weave, satin weave, or twill weave. Woven cloth can be plain or classic (in one colour or a simple pattern), or can be woven in decorative or artistic design.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2011,Commons category link from Wikidata,Short description matches Wikidata,Weaving,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with IEU identifiers",Weaving,Ткачество,"0.0187,0.0425,0.0258,0.0218,0.029,0.0266,0.0202,0.0187,0.021,0.0385,0.0226,0.021,0.0258,0.0226,0.5187,0.0353,0.0218,0.0187,0.0242,0.0266",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8850753/pexels-photo-8850753.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

With roots in military obstacle course training and martial arts, parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, and quadrupedal movement—whatever is suitable for the situation.Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others, and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere. It involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and envisioning the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.Parkour as a type of movement was established by David Belle in France in 1988, however the practice of similar movements in communities around the world brings into question the relevance of such an attribution. The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, video games, and advertisements.","Acrobatic sports,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from January 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2013,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 errors: bare URL,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 errors: missing title,CS1 errors: unsupported parameter,Games and sports introduced in 1988,Jumping sports,Outdoor recreation,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Parkour,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in France,Use dmy dates from February 2017,Webarchive template wayback links",Parkour,Паркур,"0.0736,0.0375,0.0315,0.0245,0.0455,0.0475,0.0806,0.0335,0.0335,0.0385,0.1767,0.0295,0.0235,0.0606,0.0325,0.0315,0.0666,0.0295,0.0726,0.0305",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6009247/pexels-photo-6009247.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'speed bag' suspended below a fabric wing.  Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.","Adventure travel,Air sports,Aircraft configurations,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing German-language text,Articles containing Spanish-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons link from Wikidata,Individual sports,Paragliding,Short description matches Wikidata,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Paragliding,Парапланеризм,"0.0372,0.0223,0.0372,0.0312,0.0382,0.0501,0.0273,0.0511,0.0332,0.0471,0.0918,0.2297,0.0303,0.0273,0.0372,0.0342,0.0541,0.0263,0.067,0.0273",https://images.pexels.com/photos/163228/paragliding-mountains-sport-paraglider-163228.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

316,architecture,Architecture,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture,"Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton ""architect"", from ἀρχι- ""chief"" and τέκτων ""creator"") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture for civilizations on all seven continents. For this reason, architecture is considered to be a form of art. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. The earliest surviving text on architectural theory is the 1st century AD treatise De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius, according to whom a good building embodies firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (durability, utility, and beauty). Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas further, seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to be found in their proportions. Giorgio Vasari wrote Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects and put forward the idea of style in the Western arts in the 16th century. In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared that ""form follows function"". ""Function"" began to replace the classical ""utility"" and was understood to include not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural dimensions. The idea of sustainable architecture was introduced in the late 20th century.
Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed from trial and error to successful replication. Ancient urban architecture was preoccupied with building religious structures and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers until Greek and Roman architecture shifted focus to civic virtues. Indian and Chinese architecture influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist architecture in particular took diverse local flavors. During the European Middle Ages, pan-European styles of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the Renaissance favored Classical forms implemented by architects known by name. Later, the roles of architects and engineers became separated. Modern architecture began after World War I as an avant-garde movement that sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. Emphasis was put on modern techniques, materials, and simplified geometric forms, paving the way for high-rise superstructures. Many architects became disillusioned with modernism which they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and postmodern and contemporary architecture developed.
Over the years, the field of architectural construction has branched out to include everything from ship design to interior decorating.","All articles with unsourced statements,Architectural design,Architecture,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2016,CS1 Romanian-language sources (ro),CS1 errors: missing periodical,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from February 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LNB identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Architecture,Архитектура,"0.0578,0.0204,0.0147,0.0679,0.3041,0.0525,0.0204,0.0204,0.0173,0.0173,0.013,0.0173,0.1702,0.0134,0.0125,0.0327,0.0169,0.0156,0.0714,0.0441",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2414036/pexels-photo-2414036.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
317,baseball,Baseball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball,"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.","All accuracy disputes,All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from June 2019,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with dead external links from February 2021,Articles with disputed statements from January 2019,Articles with disputed statements from January 2021,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Ball games,Basketball,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,Games and sports introduced in 1891,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using infobox sport with unknown parameters,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in the United States,Summer Olympic sports,Team sports,Use mdy dates from February 2021,Vague or ambiguous time from July 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Baseball,Бейсбол,"0.0108,0.0139,0.0148,0.0117,0.01,0.0131,0.0268,0.017,0.0108,0.0259,0.0139,0.0122,0.0135,0.01,0.0166,0.0179,0.0463,0.6647,0.0259,0.0241",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1757433/pexels-photo-1757433.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

A person who engages in these activities is known as a bus spotter, bus fan (Chinese: 巴士迷; popular name in Hong Kong), bus enthu (term in Singapore), bus nut (term popular in the UK) or bus enthusiast (although this term can also cover preservationists). Within the bus industry bus spotters are known as moquettes, from the material used to make the seat coverings. There are many enthusiasts of the bus and coach industry across the globe. Like train and aircraft spotters, bus spotters spend much time outdoors with notepads, cameras or camcorders, monitoring bus routes.Bus spotters are often uninterested in timetables and network quality, but they may be interested in new liveries, especially ad-hoc schemes to advertise particular products or events. Some may be so keen that they might track a vehicle through its life, knowing for example which fleet numbers it has carried with different owners and when mechanical parts or interior fittings were renewed. Bus spotting has never been as popular as train spotting in the UK, but enthusiasts can share the common term of ""gricer"".
Since bus spotting involves urban mass transit, it often goes hand in hand with metrophily. In New York, the two are often combined into ""transit fan"", a person who studies both bus and rail rapid transit, with the same diligence.

321,taekwondo,Taekwondo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo,"Taekwondo, Tae Kwon Do or Taekwon-Do (; Korean: 태권도/跆拳道 [tʰɛ.k͈wʌn.do] (listen)) is a Korean martial art, characterized by punching and kicking techniques, with emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques. The literal translation for tae kwon do is ""kicking,"" ""punching,"" and ""the art or way of."" It is a martial art that attacks or defends with hands and feet anytime, anywhere without any weapons, and the purpose of physical training is important, but it also has great significance in fostering the right mind through mental armament.Taekwondo practitioners wear a uniform, known as a dobok. It is a combat sport and was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate, Chinese martial arts, and indigenous Korean martial arts traditions such as Taekkyon, Subak, and Gwonbeop. The oldest governing body for Taekwondo is the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from the nine original kwans, or martial arts schools, in Korea. The main international organisational bodies for Taekwondo today are the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), founded by Choi Hong Hi in 1966, and the partnership of the Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly World Taekwondo Federation or WTF), founded in 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea Taekwondo Association. Gyeorugi ([kjʌɾuɡi]), a type of full-contact sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000. The governing body for Taekwondo in the Olympics and Paralympics is World Taekwondo.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Korean-language text,Articles needing additional references from June 2021,Articles with dead external links from March 2018,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from March 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2020,CS1 Korean-language sources (ko),CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt),CS1 maint: extra text: authors list,Combat sports,Commons category link from Wikidata,Dynamic lists,Games and sports introduced in 1955,Korean culture,Korean martial arts,Mixed martial arts styles,Short description matches Wikidata,Sports originating in Korea,Summer Olympic sports,Taekwondo,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia pending changes protected pages",Taekwondo,Тхэквондо,"0.0366,0.0233,0.028,0.1049,0.0632,0.0451,0.0983,0.0261,0.0214,0.028,0.0613,0.0404,0.0356,0.028,0.0432,0.0508,0.0594,0.0774,0.0708,0.0584",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6253180/pexels-photo-6253180.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The modern wingsuit, first developed in the late 1990s, creates a surface area with fabric between the legs and under the arms.  Wingsuits are sometimes referred to as ""birdman suits"" (after the makers of the first commercial wingsuit), ""squirrel suits"" (from their resemblance to flying squirrels' wing membrane), and ""bat suits"" (due to their resemblance to the animal or perhaps the superhero).
A wingsuit flight ends by deploying a parachute, and so a wingsuit can be flown from any point that provides sufficient altitude for flight and parachute deployment – a skydiving drop aircraft, or BASE-jump exit point such as a tall cliff or mountain top. The wingsuit flier wears parachute equipment specially designed for skydiving or BASE jumping. While the parachute flight is normal, the canopy pilot must unzip arm wings (after deployment) to be able to reach the steering parachute toggles and control the descent path.","20th-century inventions,Air sports,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2014,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 errors: missing periodical,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Gliding,Outdoor recreation,Parachuting,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from October 2020",Wingsuit flying,Вингсьют,"0.0193,0.0317,0.0235,0.0185,0.0218,0.035,0.0457,0.0342,0.0193,0.0481,0.0374,0.2103,0.021,0.0391,0.0374,0.0202,0.2086,0.0391,0.063,0.0267",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1262304/pexels-photo-1262304.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

324,meditation,Meditation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation,"Mediation  is a structured, interactive process where an impartial third party assists disputing parties in resolving conflict through the use of specialized communication and negotiation techniques. All participants in mediation are encouraged to actively participate in the process. Mediation is a ""party-centered"" process in that it is focused primarily upon the needs, rights, and interests of the parties. The mediator uses a wide variety of techniques to guide the process in a constructive direction and to help the parties find their optimal solution. A mediator is facilitative in that she/he manages the interaction between parties and facilitates open communication. Mediation is also evaluative in that the mediator analyzes issues and relevant norms (""reality-testing""), while refraining from providing prescriptive advice to the parties (e.g., ""You should do..."").
Mediation, as used in law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution resolving disputes between two or more parties with concrete effects. Typically, a third party, the mediator, assists the parties to negotiate a settlement. Disputants may mediate disputes in a variety of domains, such as commercial, legal, diplomatic, workplace, community, and family matters.
The term mediation broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps others reach an agreement. More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable, and dynamics that ""ordinary"" negotiation lacks. The process is private and confidential, possibly enforced by law. Participation is typically voluntary. The mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs the process. Mediation is becoming a more peaceful and internationally accepted solution to end the conflict. Mediation can be used to resolve disputes of any magnitude.
The term mediation, however, due to language as well as national legal standards and regulations is not identical in content in all countries but rather has specific connotations, and there are some differences between Anglo-Saxon definitions and other countries, especially countries with a civil, statutory law tradition.Mediators use various techniques to open, or improve, dialogue and empathy between disputants, aiming to help the parties reach an agreement. Much depends on the mediator's skill and training. As the practice gained popularity, training programs, certifications, and licensing followed, which produced trained and professional mediators committed to the discipline.","All accuracy disputes,All articles needing additional references,All articles with incomplete citations,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles needing additional references from January 2014,Articles needing additional references from October 2006,Articles needing additional references from October 2017,Articles with disputed statements from May 2018,Articles with incomplete citations from October 2015,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2008,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2008,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Mediation,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from April 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2012,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from May 2010,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Meditation,Медитация,"0.4737,0.042,0.0179,0.0293,0.0322,0.0253,0.0632,0.0145,0.0145,0.0391,0.0307,0.0184,0.013,0.0214,0.017,0.0278,0.046,0.0204,0.0386,0.015",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2597205/pexels-photo-2597205.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

329,quilting,Quilting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilting,"Quilting is the term given to the process of joining a minimum of three layers of fabric together either through stitching manually by hand using a needle and thread, or mechanically with a sewing machine or specialised longarm quilting system. An array of stitches is passed through all layers of the fabric to create a three dimensional padded surface. The three layers are typically referred to as the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and the backing.
Quilting varies from a purely functional fabric joinery technique to highly elaborate, decorative three dimensional surface treatments. A wide variety of textile products are traditionally associated with quilting that includes bed coverings, soft home furnishings, garments and costumes, wall hangings, artistic objects and cultural artefacts.
A wide range of effects can be employed by the quilter that contribute to the final surface quality and utility of the quilted material. The quilter controls these effects through the manipulation of elements such as material type and thickness, stitch length and style, pattern design, piecing and cutting. Two dimensional effects such as optical illusions can be achieved through aesthetic choices regarding colour, texture and print. Three dimensional and sculptural components of quilted material can be manipulated and enhanced with further embellishment which may include appliqué, embroidery techniques such as shisha mirror work, and the inclusion of other objects or elements such as pearls, beads, buttons, sequins. Some quilters dye or create their own fabrics. In contemporary artistic quilting, new and experimental materials such as plastics, paper, naturally occurring fibres and plants amongst a diverse array of other materials have been used.
Quilting can be considered one of the first examples of upcycling, as it has historically made extensive use of remnants and offcuts for the creation of new products.

331,r/c helicopters,Radio-controlled helicopter,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_helicopter,"A radio-controlled helicopter (also RC helicopter) is model aircraft which is distinct from a RC airplane because of the differences in construction, aerodynamics, and flight training. Several basic designs of RC helicopters exist, of which some (such as those with collective pitch control) are more maneuverable than others. The more maneuverable designs are often harder to fly, but benefit from greater aerobatic capabilities.Flight controls allow pilots to control the collective (or throttle, on fixed pitch helicopters), the cyclic controls (pitch and roll), and the tail rotor (yaw). Controlling these in unison enables the helicopter to perform the same maneuvers as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many other maneuvers that full-sized helicopters cannot, such as inverted flight (where collective pitch control provides negative blade pitch to hold heli up inverted, and pitch/yaw controls must be reversed by pilot).The various helicopter controls are effected by means of small servo motors, commonly known as servos. A solid-state gyroscope sensor is typically used on the tail rotor (yaw) control to counter wind- and torque-reaction-induced tail movement.  Most newer helicopters have gyro-stabilization on the other 2 axis of rotation (pitch and roll) as well.  Such 3-axis gyro is typically called a flybarless controller, so-called because it eliminates the need for a mechanical flybar.The engines typically used to be methanol-powered two-stroke motors, but electric brushless motors combined with a high-performance lithium polymer battery (LiPo) are now more common and provide improved efficiency, performance, and lifespan compared to brushed motors, while decreasing prices bring them within reach of hobbyists. Gasoline and jet turbine engines are also used.Just like full sized helicopters, model helicopter rotors turn at high speeds and can cause severe injuries. Several deaths have occurred as recently as 2013.

333,sand castles,Sand art and play,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_art_and_play,"Sand art is the practice of modelling sand into an artistic form, such as a sand brushing, sand sculpture, sandpainting, or sand bottles. A sandcastle is a type of sand sculpture resembling a miniature building, often a castle. The drip castle variation uses wet sand that is dribbled down to form organic shapes before the sands dries.
Most sand play takes place on sandy beaches, where the two basic building ingredients, sand and water, are available in abundance. Sandpits are also common. Tidal beaches generally have sand that limits height and structure because of the shape of the sand grains. Good sculpture sand is somewhat dirty, having silt and clay that helps lock the irregular-shaped sand grains together.
Sand castles are typically made by children for fun, but there are also sand-sculpture contests for adults that involve large, complex constructions. The largest sandcastle made in a contest was 18 feet tall; the owner, Ronald Malcnujio, a five-foot-high man, had to use several ladders, each the height of the sandcastle. His sculpture consisted of one ton of sand and 10 litres of water to sculpt.","All articles to be split,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles prone to spam from March 2014,Articles to be split from January 2021,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2020,Beaches,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Leisure activities,Outdoor sculptures,Sand art,Sculpture techniques,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Sand Castles,Замки из песка,"0.0291,0.0185,0.0276,0.017,0.2725,0.0231,0.0404,0.0314,0.0238,0.0185,0.0586,0.0616,0.0336,0.0639,0.0533,0.0661,0.0382,0.0525,0.0533,0.017",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2613015/pexels-photo-2613015.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The palms of the hands are typically touching the sides of the body and the toes are typically touching the ground. Some players compete to find the most unusual and original location in which to play. The term planking refers to mimicking a wooden plank. Planking can include lying flat on a flat surface, or holding the body flat while it is supported in only some regions, with other parts of the body suspended. Many participants in planking have photographed the activity in unusual locations and have shared such pictures through social media.

336,water polo,Water polo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo,"Water polo is a competitive team sport played in water between two teams of 7 players each. The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. Each team is made up of six field players and one goalkeeper. Excluding the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool so that players cannot touch the bottom.
A game of water polo mainly consists of the players swimming to move about the pool, treading water (mainly using the eggbeater kick), passing the ball, and shooting at the goal. Teamwork, tactical thinking and awareness are also highly important aspects in a game of water polo. Water polo is a highly physical and demanding sport and has frequently been cited as one of the most difficult sports to play.Special equipment for water polo includes a water polo ball, a ball of varying colors which floats on the water; numbered and coloured caps; and two goals, which either float in the water or are attached to the sides of the pool.
The game is thought to have originated in Scotland in the mid-19th century as a sort of ""water rugby"". William Wilson is thought to have developed the game in 1870s. The game thus developed with the formation of the London Water Polo League and has since expanded, becoming popular in parts of Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, Canada and Australia.","All articles needing additional references,All articles that are too technical,Articles needing additional references from April 2016,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,Ball games,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 errors: missing periodical,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Short description matches Wikidata,Sports originating in England,Sports originating in Scotland,Sports originating in the United Kingdom,Summer Olympic sports,Team sports,Use dmy dates from March 2017,Water polo,Water sports,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles that are too technical from February 2014,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism",Water Polo,Водное поло,"0.02,0.0314,0.0306,0.0261,0.017,0.0246,0.0374,0.02,0.0238,0.0359,0.1357,0.0253,0.0351,0.0215,0.0503,0.0246,0.0299,0.3511,0.0246,0.0351",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7645829/pexels-photo-7645829.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Classical calligraphy differs from type design and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of wedding invitations and event invitations, font design and typography, original hand-lettered logo design, religious art, announcements, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone inscriptions, and memorial documents. It is also used for props and moving images for film and television, and also for testimonials, birth and death certificates, maps, and other written works.","All accuracy disputes,All articles with self-published sources,Articles containing Arabic-language text,Articles containing Chinese-language text,Articles containing Japanese-language text,Articles containing Korean-language text,Articles containing Yue Chinese-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with disputed statements from August 2016,Articles with self-published sources from February 2020,Articles with short description,Book arts,CS1 Chinese-language sources (zh),CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 uses Chinese-language script (zh),Calligraphy,Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Penmanship,Short description matches Wikidata,Typesetting,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from January 2011,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from October 2013,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from August 2016,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Calligraphy,Каллиграфия,"0.0361,0.0255,0.0199,0.0215,0.32,0.0361,0.0393,0.0199,0.1212,0.028,0.0223,0.0223,0.032,0.0191,0.0458,0.0337,0.0377,0.0199,0.032,0.0677",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3826655/pexels-photo-3826655.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Other miniature motor vehicles, such as trucks, buses, or even ATVs, etc. are often included in this general category. Because many miniature vehicles were originally aimed at children as playthings, there is no precise difference between a model car and a toy car, yet the word 'model' implies either assembly required or the accurate rendering of an actual vehicle at smaller scale. The kit building hobby became popular through the 1950s, while the collecting of miniatures by adults started to pick up momentum around 1970. Precision-detailed miniatures made specifically for adults are a significant part of the market since the mid-1980s.The scope of the vehicles involved in the hobby, according to Louis Heilbroner Hertz author of The Complete Book of Building and Collecting Model Automobiles, encompasses ""ordinary or stock automobiles, racing cars ([…]), buses, trucks, specialized service vehicles (especially fire engines), military vehicles, including such equipment as self-propelled gun carriers and mobile rocket launchers; construction equipment, including bulldozers and road rollers, tractors and related farm equipment; mobile showmen's engines, customized automobiles, hot rods, dragsters, the recently popular so-called 'funny cars', early self-propelled road carriages, and so on"".","All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify,All articles lacking in-text citations,All articles that are excessively detailed,All articles with style issues,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from September 2020,Articles lacking in-text citations from August 2016,Articles needing footnote reformatting,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2016,Collecting,Commons category link is locally defined,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Toy cars and trucks,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from April 2021,Wikipedia articles that are excessively detailed from September 2020,Wikipedia articles with style issues from September 2020",Making Model Cars,Делать модель автомобилей,"0.06,0.0383,0.0274,0.0254,0.0342,0.0383,0.0661,0.0261,0.0308,0.0606,0.0471,0.3377,0.0288,0.0491,0.0186,0.0349,0.0173,0.0186,0.022,0.0186",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3021263/pexels-photo-3021263.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

340,bicycling,Cycling,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling,"Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as ""cyclists"", ""bicyclists"", or ""bikers"". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, ""cycling"" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.
Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.
Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion. These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles. Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery. Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles, often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.","Aerobic exercise,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking reliable references from November 2010,Articles prone to spam from June 2012,Articles with dead external links from July 2019,Articles with dead external links from September 2019,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015,Cycling,Emissions reduction,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sustainable transport,Symbols of Illinois,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from March 2015,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Bicycling,Велосипед,"0.0138,0.0109,0.0109,0.0128,0.0109,0.0118,0.0114,0.778,0.0109,0.0114,0.0133,0.0118,0.0118,0.0109,0.0114,0.0114,0.0109,0.0128,0.0114,0.0118",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1144268/pexels-photo-1144268.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

A person who practices lapidary is known as a lapidarist. A lapidarist uses the lapidary techniques of cutting, grinding, and polishing. Hardstone carving requires specialized carving techniques.In modern contexts, a gemcutter is a person who specializes in cutting diamonds, but in older contexts refers to artists who produced hardstone carvings; engraved gems such as jade carvings, a branch of miniature sculpture or ornament in gemstone.
By extension, the term lapidary has sometimes been applied to collectors of and dealers in gems, or to anyone who is knowledgeable in precious stones.

343,american football,American football,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football,"American football, referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.
American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the ""Father of American Football"", established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs. Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football. The sport is closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game (although their rules were developed independently from those of Camp). Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football. The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football.
American football is the most popular sport in the United States. The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, with the other major levels being high school and youth football. As of 2012, nearly 1.1 million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the sport in the United States annually. The National Football League, the most popular American professional football league, has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world. The league has an annual revenue of around US$15 billion, making it the most valuable sports league in the world. Other professional leagues exist worldwide, but the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports like baseball or basketball.","1869 introductions,All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All articles containing potentially dated statements,American culture,American football,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Ball games,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt),CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Football codes,Good articles,Gridiron football,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata,Short description is different from Wikidata,Spoken articles,Sports originating in the United States,Use American English from December 2013,Use mdy dates from January 2019,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",American football,Американский футбол,"0.02,0.0216,0.0174,0.019,0.0163,0.0264,0.0131,0.0179,0.0345,0.0275,0.0553,0.0232,0.0243,0.0264,0.0227,0.0158,0.0398,0.4885,0.0329,0.0574",https://images.pexels.com/photos/264411/pexels-photo-264411.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Also Poi refers to both a style of performing art and the equipment used for engaging in poi performance. As a skill toy poi is an object or theatrical prop used for dexterity play or an object manipulation. As a performance art, poi involves swinging tethered weights through a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. Poi artists may also sing or dance while swinging their poi. Poi can be made from various materials with different handles, weights, and effects (such as fire).
Poi originated with the Māori people of New Zealand, where it is still practiced today. Poi has also gained a following in many other countries. The expansion of poi culture has led to a significant evolution of the styles practiced, the tools used, and the definition of the word ""poi.""

346,gymnastics,Gymnastics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics,"Gymnastics is a sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.
The most common form of competitive gymnastics is artistic gymnastics, which consists of, for women (WAG), the events floor, vault, uneven bars, and beam; and for men (MAG), the events floor, vault, rings, pommel horse, parallel bars, and horizontal bar.  The governing body for gymnastics throughout the world is the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). Eight sports are governed by the FIG, which include Gymnastics for All, Men's and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Trampoline (including Double Mini-trampoline), Tumbling, acrobatic, aerobic and Parkour.  Disciplines not currently recognized by FIG include wheel gymnastics, aesthetic group gymnastics, men's rhythmic gymnastics, TeamGym, and mallakhamba.
Participants in gymnastics-related sports can include young children, recreational-level athletes, and competitive athletes at varying levels of skill, including world-class athletes.","Acrobatic sports,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles to be expanded,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2002,Articles to be expanded from June 2020,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons category link from Wikidata,Gymnastics,Individual sports,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports rules and regulations,Summer Olympic sports,Webarchive template wayback links,""Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from Colliers Encyclopedia"",Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the New International Encyclopedia,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Gymnastics,Гимнастика,"0.0152,0.0185,0.0185,0.0199,0.0178,0.038,0.0623,0.0327,0.0199,0.0286,0.4529,0.0178,0.0266,0.0266,0.0481,0.0192,0.0219,0.0542,0.0374,0.0239",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1638051/pexels-photo-1638051.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
347,field hockey,Field hockey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey,"Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family. The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players use sticks made of wood, carbon fibre, fibreglass, or a combination of carbon fibre and fibreglass in different quantities, to hit a round, hard, plastic hockey ball. The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have longer sticks. The sticks have a round side and a flat side, and only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used. Use of the other side results in a foul. Goalies often have a different design of stick, although they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, which is to give it more surface area to block the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts or a skirt, a mouthguard and a jersey.
The game is played globally, particularly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States, primarily New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.Known simply as ""hockey"" in most territories, the term ""field hockey"" is used primarily in Canada and the United States where ice hockey is more popular. In Sweden, the term landhockey is used, and to some degree in Norway, where the game is governed by the Norges Bandyforbund.During play, goal keepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body, while field players can only play the ball with the flat side of their stick. A player's hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick. If the ball is touched with the rounded part of the stick, it will result in a penalty. Goal keepers also cannot play the ball with the back of their stick.
The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time, or there is a penalty shoot-out, depending on the format of the competition. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules. In American college play, a seven-aside overtime period consists of a 10-minute golden goal period with seven players for each team. If a tie still remains, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the 25-yard (23 m) line down to the circle against the opposing goalie. The player has eight seconds to score against the goalie while keeping the ball in bounds. The game ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one-on-one) or time expires. If the tie still persists, more rounds are played until one team has scored.
The governing body of field hockey is the International Hockey Federation (FIH), called the Fédération Internationale de Hockey in French, with men and women being represented internationally in competitions including the Olympic Games, World Cup, World League, Champions Trophy and Junior World Cup, with many countries running extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the Hockey Rules Board and developing the rules of the game.
A popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey, which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, using a field which is reduced to approximately 40 m × 20 m (131 ft × 66 ft). Although many of the rules remain the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal, players may not hit the ball, instead using pushes to transfer it, and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers, from which the ball will rebound and remain in play. In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor one.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,All self-contradictory articles,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing Icelandic-language text,Articles containing Middle French (ca. 1400-1600)-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from November 2017,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2007,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020,Ball games,CS1: long volume value,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,CS1 maint: postscript,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Field hockey,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Hockey,Pages using infobox sport with unknown parameters,Self-contradictory articles from August 2019,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in England,Summer Olympic sports,Team sports,Use dmy dates from October 2020,Vague or ambiguous time from January 2015,Vague or ambiguous time from October 2020,Variations of hockey,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from August 2019,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2016,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Field hockey,Полевой хоккей,"0.0116,0.0126,0.0271,0.0143,0.0167,0.0095,0.0202,0.0423,0.0147,0.015,0.0305,0.0281,0.0126,0.0102,0.0454,0.0195,0.0485,0.5654,0.0261,0.0298",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7499846/pexels-photo-7499846.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Indoor climbing, sport climbing and bouldering are also considered variants of mountaineering by some.Unlike most sports, mountaineering lacks widely-applied formal rules, regulations, and governance; mountaineers adhere to a large variety of techniques and philosophies when climbing mountains. Numerous local alpine clubs support mountaineers by hosting resources and social activities. A federation of alpine clubs, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA), is the International Olympic Committee-recognized world organization for mountaineering and climbing.

350,garage saleing,Garage sale,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_sale,"A garage sale (also known as a yard sale, tag sale, moving sale and by many other names) is an informal event for the sale of used goods by private individuals, in which sellers are not required to obtain business licenses or collect sales tax (though, in some jurisdictions, a permit may be required).
Typically the goods in a garage sale are unwanted items from the household with its owners conducting the sale. The conditions of the goods vary, but they are usually usable. Some of these items are offered for sale because the owner does not want or need the item to minimize their possessions or to raise funds. Popular motivations for a garage sale are for ""spring cleaning,"" moving or earning extra money. The seller's items are displayed to the passers-by or those responding to signs, flyers, classified ads or newspaper ads. In some cases, local television stations will broadcast a sale on a local public channel.  The venue at which the sale is conducted is typically a garage; other sales are conducted at a driveway, carport, front yard or inside a house. Some vendors, known as ""squatters,"" will set up in a high-traffic area rather than on their own property.
Items typically sold at garage sales include old clothing, books, toys, household decorations, lawn and garden tools, sports equipment and board games. Larger items like furniture and occasionally home appliances are also sold. Garage sales occur most frequently in rural and suburban areas on weekends with good weather conditions, and usually have designated hours for the sale. Buyers who arrive before the hours of the sale to review the items are known as ""early birds"" and are often professional restorers or resellers. Such sales also attract people who are searching for bargains or for rare and unusual items. Bargaining, also known as haggling, on prices is routine, and items may or may not have price labels affixed. Some people buy goods from these sales to restore them for resale.
Some jurisdictions require that the home owners obtain a permit (which may require a fee), stating the date(s) on which the sale will take place (with allowances in the event of bad weather conditions). The jurisdiction may also place restrictions on the sale, such as the number of sales in a year a person can have (so as to avoid a person running a business without licenses and without collecting sales taxes), where signs may be placed in and around the neighborhood, and even where on the owner's premises a sale may take place.","Articles with Curlie links,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with limited geographic scope from December 2010,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Garages (residential),Non-store retailing,Retail formats,Reuse,Spoken articles,United States-centric,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Garage Saleing,Гаражная распродажа,"0.02,0.0668,0.011,0.016,0.029,0.0286,0.0146,0.0529,0.0137,0.0326,0.0205,0.0344,0.0182,0.0367,0.0133,0.4568,0.0317,0.0479,0.0218,0.0335",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7319118/pexels-photo-7319118.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Repair is not necessarily the same as home improvement, although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, it is also useful to establish limits on how much time and money you're willing to invest before deciding a repair (or list of repairs) is overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.","All articles needing additional references,Articles needing additional references from January 2017,Home,Maintenance",Home Repair,Ремонт дома,"0.0565,0.1722,0.0243,0.0289,0.0344,0.0207,0.0372,0.0785,0.0225,0.0372,0.0216,0.1933,0.0354,0.0335,0.0354,0.0308,0.0289,0.0308,0.0326,0.0455",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8447849/pexels-photo-8447849.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, such as checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, such as Cluedo. Rules can range from the very simple, such as in Snakes and Ladders; to deeply complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader.
The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules; games like chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets, but have great strategic depth.

357,shortwave listening,Shortwave listening,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_listening,"Shortwave listening, or SWLing, is the hobby of listening to shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in the technical aspects of radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.The practice of long-distance radio listening began in the 1920s when shortwave broadcasters were first established in the US and Europe. Audiences discovered that international programming was available on the shortwave bands of many consumer radio receivers, and a number of magazines and listener clubs catering to the practice arose as a result. Shortwave listening was especially popular during times of international conflict such as World War II, the Korean War and the Persian Gulf War.
Listeners use inexpensive portable world band receivers to access the shortwave bands, and some advanced hobbyists employ specialized shortwave communications receivers featuring digital technology as well as Digital signal processing designed for optimum reception of shortwave signals, along with outdoor antennas to enhance performance. Many hobbyists also choose to use Software-defined radio receivers for their benefits over traditional radios. 
With the advent of the Internet, many international broadcasters have scaled back or terminated their shortwave transmissions in favor of web-based program distribution, while others are moving from traditional analog to digital broadcasting modes in order to allow more efficient delivery of shortwave programming. The number of organized shortwave listening clubs has diminished along with printed magazines devoted to the hobby; however, many enthusiasts continue to exchange information and news on the web.

358,guitar,Guitar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar,"The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.
The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points.  Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States; nylon strings came in the 1940s. The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.
There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played  across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar"". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.
Electric guitars, first patented in 1937, use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood needing no resonant chamber.  A wide array of electronic effects units became possible including reverb and distortion (or ""overdrive""). Solid-body guitars began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback. As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music.
The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock. The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, mariachi, metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and pop.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing Andalusian Arabic-language text,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing German-language text,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing Spanish-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from February 2020,Articles needing additional references from February 2021,Articles with hAudio microformats,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2011,Blues instruments,CS1 maint: uses authors parameter,C instruments,Classical music instruments,Folk music instruments,Guitars,Harv and Sfn no-target errors,Necked box lutes,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Rhythm section,Short description matches Wikidata,String instruments,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MusicBrainz instrument identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Guitar,Гитара,"0.0101,0.0245,0.0348,0.0097,0.0169,0.0124,0.0413,0.0127,0.5573,0.0097,0.0489,0.0105,0.0192,0.0105,0.0283,0.0093,0.0615,0.0428,0.0257,0.0139",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4090165/pexels-photo-4090165.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
359,orienteering,Orienteering,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering,"Orienteering is a group of sports that require navigational skills using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed. Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared orienteering map, which they use to find control points. Originally a training exercise in land navigation for military officers, orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and the most popular is foot orienteering.  For the purposes of this article, foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, but almost any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation with a map is a type of orienteering.
Orienteering is included in the programs of world sporting events including the World Games (see Orienteering at the World Games) and World Police and Fire Games.

360,economy,Economy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy,"An economy (from Greek οίκος – ""household"" and νέμoμαι – ""manage"") is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents. In general, it is defined  'as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources'. A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone.
Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain.
Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).
A market-based economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency. A command-based economy is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed. A green economy is low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. A gig economy is one in which short-term jobs are assigned or chosen via online platforms. New economy is a term that referred to the whole emerging ecosystem where new standards and practices were introduced, usually as a result of technological innovations. The global economy refers to humanity's economic system or systems overall.","All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles with long short description,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from January 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from January 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2008,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Economy,Main topic articles,Short description matches Wikidata,Use mdy dates from August 2016,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Economy,Экономика,"0.1092,0.3495,0.0394,0.0506,0.02,0.0235,0.0131,0.0497,0.0123,0.0192,0.0144,0.0136,0.0265,0.0394,0.0192,0.0213,0.0825,0.0114,0.0489,0.0364",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4386476/pexels-photo-4386476.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
361,hypnosis,Hypnosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic,"Hypnotic (from Greek Hypnos, sleep), or soporific drugs, commonly known as sleeping pills, are a class of psychoactive drugs whose primary function is to induce sleep and for the treatment of insomnia (sleeplessness), or for surgical anesthesia.This group is related to sedatives. Whereas the term sedative describes drugs that serve to calm or relieve anxiety, the term hypnotic generally describes drugs whose main purpose is to initiate, sustain, or lengthen sleep. Because these two functions frequently overlap, and because drugs in this class generally produce dose-dependent effects (ranging from anxiolysis to loss of consciousness) they are often referred to collectively as sedative-hypnotic drugs.Hypnotic drugs are regularly prescribed for insomnia and other sleep disorders, with over 95% of insomnia patients being prescribed hypnotics in some countries. Many hypnotic drugs are habit-forming and, due to many factors known to disturb the human sleep pattern, a physician may instead recommend changes in the environment before and during sleep, better sleep hygiene, the avoidance of caffeine or other stimulating substances, or behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) before prescribing medication for sleep. When prescribed, hypnotic medication should be used for the shortest period of time necessary.Among individuals with sleep disorders, 13.7% are taking or prescribed nonbenzodiazepines, while 10.8% are taking benzodiazepines, as of 2010, in the USA. Early classes of drugs, such as barbiturates, have fallen out of use in most practices but are still prescribed for some patients. In children, prescribing hypnotics is not yet acceptable unless used to treat night terrors or sleepwalking. Elderly people are more sensitive to potential side effects of daytime fatigue and cognitive impairments, and a meta-analysis found that the risks generally outweigh any marginal benefits of hypnotics in the elderly. A review of the literature regarding benzodiazepine hypnotics and Z-drugs concluded that these drugs can have adverse effects, such as dependence and accidents, and that optimal treatment uses the lowest effective dose for the shortest therapeutic time period, with gradual discontinuation in order to improve health without worsening of sleep.Falling outside the above-mentioned categories, the neuro-hormone melatonin has a hypnotic function.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with failed verification,All articles with unsourced statements,All pages needing factual verification,Articles needing additional medical references from May 2016,Articles requiring reliable medical sources,Articles with failed verification from February 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2014,CS1: long volume value,Hypnotics,Psychoactive drugs,Treatment of sleep disorders,Wikipedia articles needing factual verification from September 2019,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from February 2014,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with multiple identifiers",Hypnosis,Гипноз,"0.1491,0.0229,0.0309,0.0354,0.0234,0.0138,0.0143,0.1099,0.0118,0.0204,0.0163,0.0153,0.3451,0.045,0.0158,0.0229,0.0329,0.0153,0.0354,0.0239",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5028425/pexels-photo-5028425.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
362,sleeping,Sleep,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep,"Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings. It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns.
Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM sleep and non-REM sleep. Although REM stands for ""rapid eye movement"", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. A well-known feature of sleep is the dream, an experience typically recounted in narrative form, which resembles waking life while in progress, but which usually can later be distinguished as fantasy. During sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night. The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with long short description,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Mental states,Pages using div col with small parameter,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sleep,Unsolved problems in neuroscience,Use dmy dates from May 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from August 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Sleeping,Сон,"0.257,0.0288,0.0645,0.1762,0.014,0.0241,0.0253,0.052,0.0211,0.014,0.0663,0.0377,0.0152,0.0401,0.0306,0.0253,0.0371,0.0181,0.0211,0.0318",https://images.pexels.com/photos/989088/pexels-photo-989088.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

365,netball,Netball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netball,"Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players. Netball is most popular in many Commonwealth nations and according to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries. Major domestic leagues in the sport include the Netball Superleague in Great Britain, Suncorp Super Netball in Australia and the ANZ Premiership in New Zealand. Four major competitions take place internationally: the quadrennial World Netball Championships, the Commonwealth Games, and the yearly Quad Series and Fast5 Series. In 1995, netball became an International Olympic Committee recognised sport, but it has not been played at the Olympics.
Games are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.
Its development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed. As of 2019, the INF comprises more than 70 national teams organized into five global regions.","Articles containing video clips,Articles with short description,Ball games,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Forms of basketball,Good articles,Netball,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in England,Team sports,Use British English from March 2011,Use dmy dates from November 2020,Wikipedia articles with AWR identifiers,Wikipedia pages semi-protected from banned users",Netball,Нетбол,"0.0234,0.0306,0.0202,0.0218,0.0226,0.0298,0.0425,0.0401,0.0218,0.0417,0.0306,0.0187,0.0337,0.0337,0.0345,0.0218,0.0266,0.4075,0.0718,0.0266",https://unsplash.com/photos/oeGMaLjUOxQ/download
366,sporting dog field trials,Field trial,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_trial,"A field trial is a competitive event at which dogs compete against one another for placements. There are field trials for retrievers, pointing dogs and flushing dogs. Field trials are usually organized by kennel clubs or other gun dog organizations.  Field trials are generally considered more competitive than hunt tests in that success at a field trial requires a higher level of training than simply qualifying to the standard that a hunt test requires. For example, in Retriever Field Trials, dogs retrieve over longer distances with a more complex path than a Retriever Hunt Test would generally provide. Field trial dogs are trained to a much higher degree of training in order to be competitive in the sport. Their purpose is also different, as they compete for 1st-4th, Reserve Judges' Award of Merit and Judges' Award of Merit, while hunting tests are judged on whether the standard is met or not.
The term is confusing as it means different things to different breed organizations.  With sporting dogs field trials demand that dogs compete against one another for placements. In most hunt tests, on the other hand, dogs are evaluated against a written standard and all of the dogs in the hunt test may qualify if they meet the standard.  To further complicate the issue, various kennel organizations have differing definitions of field trial.
Field trials come in various grades including Open, Limited Open, Amateur, Qualifying, Owner-Handler Qualifying and Derby, Sanctioned and non-sanctioned.  An Open field trial permits entry from any handler or trainer while a Limited Open only quaified dogs can compete. An Amateur trial only permits non-professional handlers/trainers and a Derby trial is for dogs under two years of age. Sanctioned trials are ones that are held under the control of a national kennel club or organization, while the non-sanctioned can be organized by a local club.

369,jurisprudence,Jurisprudence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence,"Jurisprudence, or legal theory, is the theoretical study of law. Scholars of jurisprudence seek to explain the nature of law in its most general form and provide a deeper understanding of legal reasoning and analogy, legal systems, legal institutions, and the role of law in society.Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists.This article addresses three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. Ancient natural law is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain whatever force they have. Analytic jurisprudence (Clarificatory jurisprudence) rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems. It encompasses such theories of jurisprudence as ""legal positivism"", which holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from basic social facts; and ""legal realism"", which argues that the real-world practice of law determines what law is, the law having the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers, and judges do with it. Normative jurisprudence is concerned with ""evaluative"" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. It not only addresses the question ""What is law?"", but also tries to determine what the proper function of law should be, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.","Academic disciplines,All articles needing additional references,All articles that may contain original research,Articles needing additional references from June 2018,Articles that may contain original research from June 2018,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,CS1 maint: others,Jurisprudence,Law,Legal ethics,Philosophy of law,Roman law,Short description is different from Wikidata,Social philosophy,Social sciences,Use dmy dates from July 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Jurisprudence,Юриспруденция,"0.4892,0.0125,0.0136,0.1098,0.0438,0.0356,0.0392,0.0187,0.0131,0.0428,0.0177,0.0146,0.0197,0.0131,0.0166,0.0141,0.0207,0.0172,0.0305,0.0177",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5668789/pexels-photo-5668789.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget.
There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films or compose the music score for their films.

374,ballooning,Ballooning (spider),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_(spider),"Ballooning, sometimes called kiting, is a process by which spiders, and some other small invertebrates, move through the air by releasing one or more gossamer threads to catch the wind, causing them to become airborne at the mercy of air currents and electric currents. A 2018 experiment confirmed that electric fields provide enough force to lift spiders in the air. This is primarily used by spiderlings to disperse; however, larger individuals have been observed doing so as well. The spider climbs to a high point and takes a stance with its abdomen to the sky, releasing fine silk threads from its spinneret until it becomes aloft. Journeys achieved vary from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres. Even atmospheric samples collected from balloons at five kilometres altitude and ships mid-ocean have reported spider landings. Mortality is high.It is observed in many species of spiders, such as Erigone atra, Cyclosa turbinata, as well as in spider mites (Tetranychidae) and in 31 species of lepidoptera, distributed in 8 suborders. Bell and his colleagues put forward the hypothesis that ballooning first appeared in the Cretaceous. A 5-year-long research study in the 1920s–1930s revealed that 1 in every 17 invertebrates caught mid-air is a spider. Out of 28,739 specimens, 1,401 turned out to be spiders.","All articles with unsourced statements,Arachnology,Articles containing video clips,Articles with long short description,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2013,CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list,Ethology,Gliding animals,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2014,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from November 2019",Ballooning,Полеты на воздушном шаре,"0.0308,0.0236,0.0292,0.0691,0.0236,0.0196,0.0404,0.0412,0.022,0.2346,0.0284,0.0452,0.0196,0.054,0.058,0.0588,0.0292,0.0452,0.0795,0.0484",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5736141/pexels-photo-5736141.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The three disciplines in modern fencing are the  foil, the épée, and the sabre (also saber); winning points are made through the weapon's contact with an opponent. A fourth discipline, singlestick, appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is not a part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics. Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing, and the French school later refining the Italian system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, épée, and sabre. Most competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only.
Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern Olympic Games, the other four being athletics, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics.

Even though scientific research may not be their primary goal, some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science, such as by monitoring variable stars, double stars, sunspots, or occultations of stars by the Moon or asteroids, or by discovering transient astronomical events, such as comets, galactic novae or supernovae in other galaxies.Amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support, and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject.  Most amateurs are hobbyists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers. Many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century, professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities.Amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing the Sun and solar eclipses.  Some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars, but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories. Amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies, which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects. They can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public.","All articles needing additional references,All articles to be expanded,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,All articles with unsourced statements,Amateur astronomy,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from September 2017,Articles to be expanded from November 2013,Articles using small message boxes,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from September 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2017,CS1 errors: bare URL,CS1 errors: missing title,Citizen science,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use mdy dates from July 2019,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers",Stargazing,Любительская астрономия,"0.0203,0.015,0.017,0.6384,0.0183,0.0176,0.0183,0.015,0.0163,0.0163,0.0236,0.0176,0.0256,0.017,0.0243,0.0216,0.015,0.0263,0.021,0.0156",https://images.pexels.com/photos/33825/milky-way-rocks-night-landscape.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
378,painting,Painting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting,"Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the ""matrix"" or ""support""). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called ""a painting""). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.
Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract art). Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).
A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing French-language text,Articles containing Italian-language text,Articles containing Spanish-language text,Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2015,CS1 Portuguese-language sources (pt),CS1 errors: dates,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Painting,Painting techniques,Short description matches Wikidata,Use dmy dates from April 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from January 2018,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with HDS identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages",Painting,Рисование,"0.041,0.0231,0.0524,0.021,0.2788,0.0338,0.0452,0.0175,0.0673,0.016,0.016,0.0182,0.0744,0.0167,0.1029,0.0231,0.0388,0.016,0.0381,0.0595",https://images.pexels.com/photos/933255/pexels-photo-933255.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Speculation (without evidence) has suggested an origin from the masculine given name Samuel and anthos, the Greek word for ""flower"". One theory is that it was a feminine form of Samuel to which the already existing feminine name Anthea was added.""Samantha"" remained a rare name until the 1873 publication of the first novel in a series by Marietta Holley, featuring the adventures of a lady named ""Samantha"", wife of Josiah Allen. The series led to the rise in the name's popularity, ranking among the top 1,000 names for girls in the United States from 1880, the earliest year for which records are available, to 1902.The name was out of fashion in the United States for the majority of the first half of the 20th century but reappeared among the top 1,000 names for girls in 1958, when it ranked in 998th position, and in 1959, when it ranked in 993rd place. It fell off the top 1,000 list again until 1964, when it reappeared in 472nd place and leapt another 293 places to 179th place in 1965, coinciding with the 1964 debut of the television show, Bewitched, featuring as a lead character a young witch named ""Samantha Stephens"". 
The name has remained consistently popular in the United States since the 1960s. It has ranked among the top 200 names for girls since 1965 and among the top 100 names for girls since 1976. It was among the ten most popular names for American girls born between 1988 and 2006 and as the 15th most popular name for American girls born in 2009.In Sri Lanka, Samantha is used as a masculine given name, being one of the forms of the name of the god Saman.

381,video games,Video game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game,"A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.
Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s are simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game is the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The quickly-growing industry suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles. 
In the 2000s, the core industry centered around ""triple-A"" blockbuster games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.","American inventions,Articles prone to spam from October 2013,Articles with short description,CS1 maint: unfit URL,Digital media,Games and sports introduced in 1947,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using multiple image with auto scaled images,Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from January 2020,Video games,Webarchive template other archives,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NKC identifiers,Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism",Video Games,Видеоигры,"0.0162,0.6481,0.0143,0.0105,0.0152,0.0209,0.0321,0.0129,0.0321,0.0124,0.0124,0.0176,0.0134,0.0176,0.0284,0.0105,0.0134,0.0326,0.0284,0.011",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4148890/pexels-photo-4148890.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
382,airsoft,Airsoft,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft,"Airsoft is a competitive team shooting sport in which participants eliminate opposing players by tagging them out of play with spherical plastic projectiles launched via replica air weapons called airsoft guns.
Although very similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not leave visible markings on their target and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellets sometimes leave bruises or welts on exposed skin (protective gear recommended), the game relies heavily on an honor system in which the player who has been hit is ethically obliged to call themselves out by shouting ""HIT"".The airsoft guns used are mostly magazine-fed, with some having manual/battery-powered spring-piston pump powerplants similar to Nerf Blasters, or pneumatically powered by replaceable compressed gas (e.g. propane (""green gas""), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or CO2) canisters.  Many airsoft guns also have mounting platforms compatible with genuine firearm accessories, and cosmetically more resembling real firearms.  This makes them popular for military simulation and historical reenactments.  There are also professional gun safety and weapon manipulation trainings conducted with airsoft in some fields, such as law enforcement trainings, due to better safety and lower cost.  The United States Coast Guard, for instance, has officially adopted airsoft for training in 2018.Airsoft gameplay varies in style and composition, but often ranges from action shooting to short organized live action role-playing (LARP) scenarios, close quarters battle skirmishes, military simulations (MilSim) or historical reenactments. It is played in indoor courses or outdoor fields.  Combat situations on the field may involve the use of genuine military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations.  A game is normally kept safe by trained professionals acting as supervisors and umpires. 
Before gameplay, an airsoft gun's muzzle velocity is usually checked through a chronograph and usually measured in feet per second (FPS).  Some countries have a set velocity or muzzle energy restriction; guns shooting over the legal velocity can be confiscated. Some playing fields further restrict minimum engagement distances, requiring players to yell ""Bang Bang!"" or another phrase instead of shooting other players at close distances. This is done to prevent possible injuries from short range, high energy pellets.

The scale models include locomotives, rolling stock, streetcars, tracks, signalling, cranes, and landscapes including: countryside, roads, bridges, buildings, vehicles, harbors, urban landscape, model figures, lights, and features such as rivers, hills, tunnels, and canyons.
The earliest model railways were the 'carpet railways' in the 1840s. The first documented model railway was the Railway of the Prince Imperial (French: Chemin de fer du Prince impérial) built in 1859 by emperor Napoleon III for his then 3-year-old son, also Napoleon, in the grounds of the Château de Saint-Cloud in Paris. It was powered by clockwork and ran in a figure-of-eight. Electric trains appeared around the start of the 20th century, but these were crude likenesses. Model trains today are more realistic, in addition to being much more technologically advanced. Today modellers create model railway layouts, often recreating real locations and periods throughout history. The world's oldest working model railway is a model designed to train signalmen on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. It is located in the National Railway Museum, York, England and dates back to 1912. It remained in use until 1995. The model was built as a training exercise by apprentices of the company's Horwich works and supplied with rolling stock by Bassett-Lowke.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2009,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 German-language sources (de),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Miniature railways,Rail transport modelling,Short description matches Wikidata,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with PLWABN identifiers",Model Railroading,Моделирование железной дороги,"0.0232,0.0248,0.0366,0.0343,0.0997,0.0398,0.0563,0.0516,0.028,0.0382,0.0319,0.247,0.0335,0.0248,0.0296,0.0571,0.0327,0.0359,0.0288,0.0461",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1074531/pexels-photo-1074531.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
384,basketball,Basketball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball,"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.","All accuracy disputes,All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Articles containing video clips,Articles needing additional references from June 2019,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with dead external links from February 2021,Articles with disputed statements from January 2019,Articles with disputed statements from January 2021,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Ball games,Basketball,CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty,Games and sports introduced in 1891,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Pages using infobox sport with unknown parameters,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sports originating in the United States,Summer Olympic sports,Team sports,Use mdy dates from February 2021,Vague or ambiguous time from July 2015,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Basketball,Баскетбол,"0.0108,0.0139,0.0148,0.0117,0.01,0.0131,0.0268,0.017,0.0108,0.0259,0.0139,0.0122,0.0135,0.01,0.0166,0.0179,0.0463,0.6647,0.0259,0.0241",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1262352/pexels-photo-1262352.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

386,surf fishing,Surf fishing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_fishing,"Surf fishing is the sport of catching fish standing on the shoreline or wading into the surf. A general term, surf fishing may or may not include casting a lure or bait, and refers to all types of shore fishing – from sandy and rocky beaches, rock jetties, or even fishing piers.  The terms surfcasting or beachcasting refer more specifically to surf fishing from the beach by casting into the surf at or near the shoreline.  With few exceptions, surf fishing is done in saltwater. The most common misconception about surf fishing is the idea that one must cast as far out as possible in order to reach the fish. At beaches on the west coast of the United States, and in fact, at most beaches around the world, you only really need to get your bait into knee-deep water. This is referred to as surf fishing the ""skinny"" (the skinny water).

387,table tennis,Table tennis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis,"Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.
Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations. The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.","All Wikipedia articles needing clarification,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2010,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2020,CS1 Japanese-language sources (ja),Commons category link from Wikidata,Racquet sports,Short description matches Wikidata,Sports originating in England,Summer Olympic sports,Table tennis,Use dmy dates from June 2018,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from September 2017,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with FAST identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Table Tennis,Настольный теннис,"0.0218,0.062,0.0278,0.0192,0.0244,0.0269,0.0244,0.0226,0.0269,0.0201,0.0372,0.0252,0.038,0.0244,0.0303,0.0346,0.0235,0.4244,0.0269,0.0594",https://images.pexels.com/photos/709134/pexels-photo-709134.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

According to the United States National Association of Rocketry (nar) Safety Code, model rockets are constructed of paper, wood, plastic and other lightweight materials. The code also provides guidelines for motor use, launch site selection, launch methods, launcher placement, recovery system design and deployment and more. Since the early 1960s, a copy of the Model Rocket Safety Code has been provided with most model rocket kits and motors. Despite its inherent association with extremely flammable substances and objects with a pointed tip traveling at high speeds, model rocketry historically has proven to be a very safe hobby and has been credited as a significant source of inspiration for children who eventually become scientists and engineers.

Most amateurs are hobbyists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers. Many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century, professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities.Amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing the Sun and solar eclipses.  Some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars, but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories. Amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies, which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects.

Further developments in psychological research have pointed to ways in which this form of dreaming may be utilized as a form of sleep therapy.","Articles with short description,CS1 French-language sources (fr),CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,Dream,Lucid dreams,Phenomena,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sleep physiology,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers",Lucid dream,Осознанные сновидения,"0.0577,0.0275,0.0286,0.0987,0.034,0.0609,0.0286,0.0297,0.0426,0.0243,0.0243,0.0318,0.0739,0.0577,0.034,0.0254,0.0351,0.0275,0.0394,0.2184",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3746226/pexels-photo-3746226.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

A pinball machine is a glass-covered cabinet containing a play field populated with lights, targets, bumpers, ramps, and various other objects depending on its design. The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by hitting targets and making various shots with the flippers, before all balls ""drain"" at an exit usually situated at the bottom of the play field. Most pinball games are divided into turns (referred to as ""balls"", having the same meaning as ""lives"" in video games). The game ends when all balls have ended.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with style issues,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing French-language text,Articles needing additional references from December 2020,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2014,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2019,Articles with unsourced statements from September 2014,CS1 Dutch-language sources (nl),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Gambling games,Individual sports,Pinball,Short description matches Wikidata,Single-player games,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from February 2010",Paintball,Пейнтбол,"0.0261,0.025,0.0728,0.0372,0.0406,0.0339,0.0294,0.0428,0.0417,0.0272,0.0572,0.0417,0.0528,0.0317,0.0294,0.025,0.0794,0.245,0.0317,0.0294",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5697195/pexels-photo-5697195.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

An antique is usually an item that is collected or desirable because of its age, beauty, rarity, condition, utility, personal emotional connection, and/or other unique features. It is an object that represents a previous era or time period in human history. Vintage and collectible are used to describe items that are old, but do not meet the 100-year criterion.Antiques are usually objects that show some degree of craftsmanship, collectability, or a certain attention to design, such as a desk or an early automobile. They are bought at antiques shops, estate sales, auction houses, online auctions, and other venues, or estate inherited. Antiques dealers often belong to national trade associations, many of which belong to CINOA, a confederation of art and antique associations across 21 countries that represents 5,000 dealers.","All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Antiques,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles needing additional references from September 2007,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from April 2015,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2009,Collecting,Nostalgia,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use dmy dates from June 2013,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2015,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers",Antiques,Антиквариат,"0.0258,0.0538,0.0197,0.0284,0.0363,0.0293,0.0223,0.0197,0.0206,0.0241,0.0206,0.0302,0.1247,0.0214,0.0284,0.381,0.0293,0.0214,0.0319,0.0311",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1359547/pexels-photo-1359547.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
400,writing songs,Songwriter,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter,"A songwriter is a musician who professionally composes musical compositions and writes lyrics for songs. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre and film scoring, but is also associated  writing and composing the original musical composition or musical bed. A songwriter who mainly writes the lyrics for a song is referred to as a lyricist. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that song writing is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. Pop songs may be composed by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees and college diplomas and ""rock schools"". Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are now often requirements for a songwriter. Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. This is governed by international copyright law.Songwriters can be employed to write either the lyrics or the music directly for or alongside a performing artist, or they present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like RowFax, the MusicRow publication and SongQuarters. Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity. Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song.

402,machining,Machining,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining,"Machining is a process in which a material (often metal) is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing, in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the ""controlled"" part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).
Machining is a part of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also be used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites. A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. A room, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop. Much of modern-day machining is carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines. This increases efficiency, as the CNC machine runs unmanned therefore reducing labour costs for machine shops.

404,weather forecasting,Weather forecasting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting,"Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place.
Once calculated manually based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition or cloud cover, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the land, and the ocean, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric and related processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and provide confidence level in the forecast.
There is a vast variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, many use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. 
Weather forecasting is a part of the economy, for example, in 2009, the US spent approximately $5.1 billion on weather forecasting, producing benefits estimated at six times as much.","All articles with dead external links,All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases,Articles prone to spam from November 2013,Articles with Spanish-language sources (es),Articles with dead external links from January 2018,Articles with dead external links from October 2017,Articles with permanently dead external links,Articles with short description,Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from April 2015,Broadcasting,CS1 errors: missing periodical,CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list,Good articles,Journalism by field,News,Short description is different from Wikidata,Sky,Use mdy dates from June 2021,Weather forecasting,Weather prediction,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with MA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers",Weather Forecasting,Прогноз погоды,"0.0313,0.1204,0.0178,0.0518,0.0228,0.0518,0.0303,0.0443,0.0183,0.0338,0.0198,0.0568,0.0598,0.0253,0.0193,0.0438,0.0283,0.0258,0.254,0.0448",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7245264/pexels-photo-7245264.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

407,blogging,Blog,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood,"Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.In vertebrates, it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes). The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma.
Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. In most insects, this ""blood"" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.
Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system.
Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled.
Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word αἷμα (haima) for ""blood"". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.","All articles lacking reliable references,All articles needing additional references,All articles with failed verification,Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking reliable references from May 2012,Articles needing additional references from July 2011,Articles needing additional references from October 2012,Articles needing more detailed references,Articles with failed verification from January 2015,Articles with short description,Blood,CS1 Latin-language sources (la),Commons category link is on Wikidata,Hematology,Short description matches Wikidata,Tissues (biology),Use dmy dates from April 2021,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia articles with TA98 identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages",Blogging,Ведение блога,"0.0234,0.0261,0.5701,0.0145,0.0118,0.0181,0.0149,0.0337,0.0167,0.0721,0.019,0.0141,0.0319,0.0355,0.0123,0.0127,0.0266,0.0105,0.023,0.0132",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7669552/pexels-photo-7669552.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
408,pinochle,Pinochle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet,"Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte (, also US: , UK: , Spanish: [awˈɣusto pinoˈ(t)ʃe(t)]; 25 November 1915 – 10 December 2006) was a Chilean Army General, politician and military dictator who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990, first as the leader of the Military Junta of Chile from 1973 to 1981, being self-declared President of the Republic by the junta in 1974 and becoming the de facto dictator of Chile, and after from 1981 to 1990 as de jure President after a new Constitution, which confirmed him in the office, was approved by a referendum in 1980.Augusto Pinochet rose through the ranks of the Chilean Army to become General Chief of Staff in early 1972 before being appointed its Commander-in-Chief on 23 August 1973 by President Salvador Allende. On 11 September 1973, 
Pinochet seized power in Chile in a coup d'état, with the support of the U.S., that toppled Allende's democratically elected Unidad Popular government and ended civilian rule. In December 1974, the ruling military junta appointed Pinochet Supreme Head of the nation by joint decree, although without the support of one of the coup's instigators, Air Force General Gustavo Leigh. After his rise to power, Pinochet persecuted leftists, socialists, and political critics, resulting in the executions of from 1,200 to 3,200 people, the internment of as many as 80,000 people, and the torture of tens of thousands. According to the Chilean government, the number of executions and forced disappearances was 3,095. Operation Condor was founded at the behest of the Pinochet regime in late November 1975, his 60th birthday.Under the influence of the free market-oriented ""Chicago Boys"", Pinochet's military government implemented economic liberalization, including currency stabilization, removed tariff protections for local industry, banned trade unions, and privatized social security and hundreds of state-owned enterprises. Some of the government properties were sold below market price to politically connected buyers, including Pinochet's own son-in-law. The regime used censorship of entertainment as a way to reward supporters of the regime and punish opponents. These policies produced high economic growth, but critics state that economic inequality dramatically increased and attribute the devastating effects of the 1982 monetary crisis on the Chilean economy to these policies. For most of the 1990s, Chile was the best-performing economy in Latin America, though the legacy of Pinochet's reforms continues to be in dispute. His fortune grew considerably during his years in power through dozens of bank accounts secretly held abroad and a fortune in real estate. He was later prosecuted for embezzlement, tax fraud, and for possible commissions levied on arms deals.Pinochet's 17-year rule was given a legal framework through a controversial 1980 plebiscite, which approved a new constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission. In a 1988 plebiscite, 56% voted against Pinochet's continuing as president, which led to democratic elections for the presidency and Congress. After stepping down in 1990, Pinochet continued to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army until 10 March 1998, when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with his 1980 Constitution. However, Pinochet was arrested under an international arrest warrant on a visit to London on 10 October 1998 in connection with numerous human rights violations. Following a legal battle, he was released on grounds of ill-health and returned to Chile on 3 March 2000. In 2004, Chilean Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia ruled that Pinochet was medically fit to stand trial and placed him under house arrest.

410,golf,Golf,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold,"Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).
Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term acid test. Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction.
A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history. In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971.
A total of 197,576 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2019. This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft). The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry. Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine. As of 2017, the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes per year.","All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing Latin-language text,Articles containing explicitly cited English-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2017,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2019,Articles containing potentially dated statements from September 2017,Articles needing additional references from February 2014,Articles with dead external links from June 2016,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from December 2016,Articles with unsourced statements from February 2015,CS1: long volume value,CS1 German-language sources (de),CS1 errors: missing periodical,Chemical elements,Chemical elements with face-centered cubic structure,Commons link is on Wikidata,Cubic minerals,Dental materials,E-number additives,Electrical conductors,Gold,Minerals in space group 225,Native element minerals,Noble metals,Precious metals,Short description is different from Wikidata,Symbols of Alaska,Symbols of California,Transition metals,Use dmy dates from May 2020,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from The American Cyclopaedia,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from The American Cyclopaedia with a Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2019,Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2011,Wikipedia articles with BNE identifiers,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages,Wikipedia pages semi-protected against vandalism",Golf,Гольф,"0.0161,0.0249,0.5271,0.0108,0.0254,0.0214,0.0174,0.024,0.0223,0.0328,0.013,0.0126,0.0192,0.0351,0.0333,0.0289,0.0205,0.0196,0.0289,0.0668",https://images.pexels.com/photos/114972/pexels-photo-114972.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
411,pigeon racing,Pigeon racing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_racing,"Pigeon racing is the sport of releasing specially trained homing pigeons, which then return to their homes over a carefully measured distance. The time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and the bird's rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest speed.
Pigeon racing requires a specific breed of pigeon bred for the sport, the Racing Homer. Competing pigeons are specially trained and conditioned for races that vary in distance from approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) to 1,000 kilometres (620 mi).  Despite these lengths, races can be won and lost by seconds, so many different timing and measuring devices have been developed. The traditional timing method involves rubber rings being placed into a specially designed clock, whereas a newer development uses RFID tags to record arrival time.
While there is no definite proof, there are compelling reasons to think the sport of racing pigeons may go back at least as far as 220 AD. Furthermore, it is recorded in the Mishnah that pigeon racers are forbidden from bearing witness. The sport achieved a great deal of popularity in Belgium in the mid-19th century. The pigeon fanciers of Belgium were so taken with the hobby that they began to develop pigeons specially cultivated for fast flight and long endurance called Voyageurs. From Belgium the modern version of the sport and the Voyageurs which the Flemish fanciers developed spread to most parts of the world. Once quite popular, the sport has experienced a downturn in participants in some parts of the world in recent years, possibly due to the rising cost of living, ageing fanciers, and a severe lack of public interest. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is also a reason why some people are leaving the sport.One recent development in the sport of pigeon racing is ""one loft racing"", where birds are raced against each other under the same training regimen, from the same location. The principle being to find the best individual race bird irrespective of the race trainer. This will determine which bird is then the most successful.","All articles with unsourced statements,Articles with unsourced statements from March 2008,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2008,Articles with unsourced statements from May 2017,Articles with unsourced statements from October 2012,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Pigeon racing,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference",Pigeon racing,Голубиные гонки,"0.0315,0.0271,0.0176,0.0282,0.0304,0.0198,0.0611,0.0533,0.0204,0.1052,0.0511,0.1354,0.0645,0.1527,0.0226,0.0271,0.0165,0.0276,0.0343,0.0734",https://images.pexels.com/photos/760984/pexels-photo-760984.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Model aircraft are divided into two basic groups: flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also termed static, display, or shelf models.
Aircraft manufacturers and researchers make wind tunnel models for testing aerodynamic properties, for basic research, or for the development of new designs. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modelled.
Static models range from mass-produced toys in white metal or plastic to highly accurate and detailed models produced for museum display and requiring thousands of hours of work. Many are available in kits, typically made of injection-moulded polystyrene or resin.
Flying models range from simple toy gliders made of sheets of paper, balsa, card stock or foam polystyrene to powered scale models built up from balsa, bamboo sticks, plastic, (including both moulded or sheet polystyrene, and styrofoam), metal, synthetic resin, either alone or with carbon fibre or fibreglass, and skinned with either tissue paper, mylar and other materials. Some can be very large, especially when used to research the flight properties of a proposed full scale aircraft.","All articles needing additional references,All articles that are excessively detailed,All articles with style issues,All pages needing cleanup,Articles needing additional references from April 2021,Articles needing cleanup from April 2010,Articles prone to spam from June 2019,Articles with multiple maintenance issues,Articles with short description,CS1 maint: archived copy as title,Cleanup tagged articles without a reason field from April 2010,Commons category link is on Wikidata,Model aircraft,Short description is different from Wikidata,Use British English from April 2021,Use dmy dates from August 2019,Wikipedia articles needing reorganization from January 2020,Wikipedia articles that are excessively detailed from January 2020,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NARA identifiers,Wikipedia articles with style issues from January 2020,Wikipedia pages needing cleanup from April 2010",Aeromodeling,Аэромоденция,"0.0204,0.0256,0.0581,0.0204,0.0211,0.0174,0.0174,0.0285,0.0219,0.027,0.0181,0.5063,0.0226,0.0196,0.0596,0.0204,0.0174,0.0219,0.0352,0.0211",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3841145/pexels-photo-3841145.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

414,us travel,United States embargo against Cuba,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba,"The United States embargo against Cuba prevents American businesses and businesses with commercial activities in the United States from conducting trade with Cuban interests. It is the most enduring trade embargo in modern history. The U.S. first imposed an embargo on the sale of arms to Cuba on March 14, 1958, during the Fulgencio Batista regime. Again on October 19, 1960, almost two years after the Cuban Revolution had led to the deposition of the Batista regime, the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American-owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation. On  February 7, 1962, the embargo was extended to include almost all exports. Since the year 2000, the embargo no longer prohibits the trade of food and humanitarian supplies.As of 2018, the embargo is enforced mainly through the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the Helms–Burton Act of 1996, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward ""democratization and greater respect for human rights."" The Helms-Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing commerce in or with Cuba, and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met. In 1999, President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba. In 2000, Clinton authorized the sale of food and humanitarian products to Cuba.
The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution every year since 1992 demanding the end of the U.S. economic blockade on Cuba.","1958 establishments in Cuba,1958 establishments in the United States,1958 in international relations,20th century in Cuba,21st century in Cuba,Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution,All Wikipedia articles written in American English,All accuracy disputes,All articles containing potentially dated statements,All articles needing additional references,All articles with dead external links,All articles with unsourced statements,All articles with vague or ambiguous time,Anti-communism in the United States,Articles containing Spanish-language text,Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2018,Articles needing additional references from July 2021,Articles needing additional references from October 2017,Articles with French-language sources (fr),Articles with dead external links from June 2021,Articles with disputed statements from January 2015,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from July 2021,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2014,Boycotts of Cuba,CS1: long volume value,CS1 Spanish-language sources (es),CS1 errors: missing periodical,Cold War history of Cuba,Cold War history of the United States,Cuba and the United Nations,Cuba–United States relations,Economy of Cuba,Embargoes,History of the foreign relations of the United States,Opposition to Fidel Castro,Short description is different from Wikidata,Tourism in Cuba,United States sanctions,Use American English from February 2019,Use mdy dates from July 2021,Vague or ambiguous time from July 2021,Webarchive template wayback links",US Travel,Путешествия по США,"0.0171,0.3204,0.0178,0.0262,0.0304,0.0157,0.059,0.0206,0.0178,0.0681,0.0171,0.0269,0.0276,0.0409,0.0227,0.0835,0.0164,0.0262,0.036,0.1094",https://images.pexels.com/photos/992763/pexels-photo-992763.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

416,boxing,Boxing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing,"Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.
Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds.
A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent.  When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.
While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.","All accuracy disputes,All articles lacking reliable references,All articles needing additional references,All articles with unsourced statements,Articles containing video clips,Articles lacking reliable references from August 2018,Articles needing additional references from March 2021,Articles with Curlie links,Articles with disputed statements from August 2018,Articles with short description,Articles with unsourced statements from August 2018,Articles with unsourced statements from June 2020,Articles with unsourced statements from November 2018,Boxing,Combat sports,European martial arts,Individual sports,Pages using Sister project links with default search,Short description is different from Wikidata,Summer Olympic sports,Use dmy dates from October 2014,Webarchive template wayback links,Wikipedia articles with BNF identifiers,Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers,Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers,Wikipedia articles with NDL identifiers,Wikipedia pending changes protected pages",Boxing,Бокс,"0.0282,0.0236,0.0184,0.0297,0.0244,0.0394,0.1828,0.0214,0.0176,0.0604,0.0912,0.0191,0.083,0.0244,0.0522,0.0349,0.0169,0.1768,0.0176,0.0379",https://images.pexels.com/photos/163403/box-sport-men-training-163403.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
417,sailing,Sailing,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing,"Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of the water (sailing ship, sailboat, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation.
Until the middle of the 19th century, sailing ships were the primary means for marine exploration, commerce, and projection of military power; this period is known as the Age of Sail. In the 21st century, most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport. Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising.  Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips, coastal sailing within sight of land, and daysailing.
Sailing relies on the physics of sails as they derive power from the wind, generating both lift and drag. On a given course, the sails are set to an angle that optimizes the development of wind power, as determined by the apparent wind, which is the wind as sensed from a moving vessel. The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course. This combination of forces means that it is possible to sail an upwind course as well as downwind. The course with respect to the true wind direction (as would be indicated by a stationary flag) is called a point of sail. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive wind power on a course with a point of sail that is too close into the wind.","Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Maint: Multiple Names: Authors List,Sailing,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers",Sailing,Парусный спорт,"0.0223,0.0179,0.0362,0.0464,0.0216,0.0238,0.0779,0.0274,0.0201,0.3556,0.0289,0.0413,0.0296,0.0267,0.0333,0.0296,0.0471,0.023,0.0647,0.0267",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1223648/pexels-photo-1223648.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Usually, the number of throws a player uses to reach each target is tallied (often in relation to par), and players seek to complete each hole in the lowest number of total throws.The game is played in about 40 countries and, as of 2020, there are 71,016 active members of the PDGA worldwide.","All Accuracy Disputes,All Articles Needing Additional References,Articles Containing Czech-Language Text,Articles Containing Estonian-Language Text,Articles Containing Finnish-Language Text,Articles Containing French-Language Text,Articles Containing Swedish-Language Text,Articles Containing Swiss Standard German-Language Text,Articles Needing Additional References From June 2020,Articles With Disputed Statements From April 2012,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Czech-Language Sources (Cs),Cs1 Estonian-Language Sources (Et),Cs1 Finnish-Language Sources (Fi),Cs1 French-Language Sources (Fr),Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Swedish-Language Sources (Sv),Disc Golf,Flying Disc Games,Forms Of Golf,Individual Sports,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Hidden Wikidata,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Wikidata Namespace Mismatch,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Sports Originating In Canada,Sports Originating In The United States,Throwing Sports,Use Dmy Dates From March 2020,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers",Disc golf,Дисковый гольф,"0.0287,0.0259,0.0344,0.0287,0.04,0.0221,0.0297,0.0673,0.0212,0.0654,0.0334,0.1172,0.0419,0.0212,0.0372,0.0391,0.057,0.218,0.0344,0.0372",https://images.pexels.com/photos/164250/pexels-photo-164250.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

421,electronics,Electronics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics,"Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter. It uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification, which distinguishes it from  classical electrical engineering which uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control current flow.
Electronics has had a major effect on the development of modern society.
The identification of the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals,  inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age. This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode, which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device.  Until 1950, this field was called ""radio technology"" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters, receivers, and vacuum tubes.
The term ""solid-state electronics"" emerged after the first working transistor was invented by William Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen at Bell Labs in 1947. The MOSFET (MOS  transistor) was later invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses, revolutionizing the electronics industry, and playing a central role in the microelectronics revolution and Digital Revolution. The MOSFET has since become the basic element in most modern electronic equipment, and is the most widely used electronic device in the world.
Electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunication, and signal processing.  The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system, called an electronic system; examples are computers or control systems. An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device. As of 2019 most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit. Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, optoelectronics, and sensors, associated passive electrical components, and interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible.
The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid-state electronics.","All Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements,All Articles Needing Additional References,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From 2019,Articles Needing Additional References From July 2012,Articles With Curlie Links,Articles With Short Description,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Electronics,Pages With Non-Numeric Formatnum Arguments,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From March 2017,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Multiple Identifiers",Electronics,Электроника,"0.0415,0.0198,0.5387,0.0262,0.027,0.0168,0.0223,0.0347,0.0411,0.036,0.0147,0.0151,0.0292,0.01,0.0177,0.01,0.01,0.0198,0.0504,0.0189",https://images.pexels.com/photos/705164/computer-laptop-work-place-camera-705164.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
422,transhumanism,Transhumanism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism,"Transhumanism is a philosophical movement, the proponents of which 
advocate and predict the enhancement of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies able to greatly enhance longevity, mood and cognitive abilities.Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations as well as the ethics of using such technologies. Some transhumanists believe that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.Another topic of transhumanist research is how to protect humanity against existential risks, such as nuclear war or asteroid collision.The contemporary meaning of the term ""transhumanism"" was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of futurology, a man who changed his name to FM-2030. In the 1960s, he taught ""new concepts of the human"" at The New School when he began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and worldviews ""transitional"" to posthumanity as ""transhuman"". The assertion would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990, and organizing in California a school of thought that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement.Influenced by seminal works of science fiction, the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives, including philosophy and religion.In 2017, Penn State University Press, in cooperation with philosopher Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and sociologist James Hughes, established the Journal of Posthuman Studies as the first academic journal explicitly dedicated to the posthuman, with the goal of clarifying the notions of posthumanism and transhumanism, as well as comparing and contrasting both.","1990 Introductions,All Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Haudio Microformats,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From October 2014,Articles With Unsourced Statements From April 2019,Articles With Unsourced Statements From December 2017,Articles With Unsourced Statements From October 2014,Bioethics,Cs1 Errors: Missing Periodical,Cs1 Maint: Multiple Names: Authors List,Cs1 Maint: Uses Authors Parameter,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Doomsday Scenarios,Emerging Technologies,Ethics Of Science And Technology,Existential Risk From Artificial General Intelligence,Futures Studies,Ideologies,Immortality,Metaphysics,Ontology,Philosophical Movements,Philosophy Of Artificial Intelligence,Philosophy Of Culture,Philosophy Of Science,Philosophy Of Technology,Posthumanism,Science Fiction Culture,Science Fiction Themes,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Singularitarianism,Singularity Theory,Social Change,Social Philosophy,Spoken Articles,Subcultures,Technological Change,Technological Utopianism,Technology Development,Technology Forecasting,Technology Hazards,Theory Of Mind,Transhumanism,Transhumanist Politics,Use Mdy Dates From October 2016,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles Needing Factual Verification From April 2020,Wikipedia Articles With Bne Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lnb Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Multiple Identifiers",Transhumanism,Трансгуманизм,"0.0418,0.0638,0.0714,0.2239,0.0535,0.0335,0.0238,0.0645,0.019,0.0411,0.0369,0.0217,0.0424,0.0328,0.0376,0.0376,0.0438,0.03,0.0528,0.028",

424,floorball,Floorball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball,"Floorball is a type of floor hockey with five players and a goalkeeper in each team. Men and women play indoors with 96–115.5 cm-long (37.8–45.5 in) sticks and a 70–72 mm-circumference (2.76–2.83 in) plastic ball with holes. Matches are played in three twenty-minute periods. Floorball was included in the World Games for the first time in 2017 in Wrocław, Poland. Sweden were the first World Games gold medal winners.
The game was invented in Sweden in the late 1960s. The basic rules were established in 1979 when the first floorball club in the world, Sala IBK, from Sala, was founded in Sweden. Official rules for matches were first written down in 1981.The sport is organized internationally by the International Floorball Federation (IFF). As of 2014, there are over 300,133 registered floorball players worldwide. Events include an annual Champions Cup, EuroFloorball Cup and EuroFloorball Challenge for club teams and the biennial World Floorball Championships with separate divisions for men and women. Norway, the Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland have consistently placed 1st, 2nd, or 3rd at the World Floorball Championships. Professional club leagues include Finland's F-liiga, Sweden's Svenska Superligan, Switzerland's National League A and the Czech Republic's Superliga florbalu.
While the IFF contains 74 members, floorball is most popular where it has been developed the longest, such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.  It is gaining popularity in Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.","All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From December 2015,Articles With Unsourced Statements From March 2009,Articles With Unsourced Statements From September 2015,Ball Games,Cs1 Danish-Language Sources (Da),Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Japanese-Language Sources (Ja),Cs1 Swedish-Language Sources (Sv),Cs1 Uses Japanese-Language Script (Ja),Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Floorball,Indoor Sports,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Sports Originating In Sweden,Team Sports,Use Dmy Dates From September 2020,Variations Of Hockey,Wikipedia Articles With Nkc Identifiers",Floorball,Флорбол,"0.0218,0.031,0.0236,0.0292,0.0208,0.0551,0.0208,0.0292,0.0282,0.0431,0.0829,0.0292,0.0338,0.0245,0.0319,0.0255,0.0301,0.3773,0.0245,0.0375",https://unsplash.com/photos/Efgocb5Y0J4/download

429,tennis,Tennis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis,"Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.
The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.
Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.","All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing Greek-Language Text,Articles With Curlie Links,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From February 2020,Ball Games,Cs1: Julian–Gregorian Uncertainty,Cs1 Maint: Multiple Names: Authors List,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Default Search,Racquet Sports,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Sports Originating In England,Summer Olympic Sports,Tennis,Use British English From July 2015,Use Dmy Dates From February 2021,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Pages Semi-Protected Against Vandalism",Tennis,Большой теннис,"0.0202,0.0222,0.0632,0.0274,0.0228,0.0539,0.0367,0.0321,0.0235,0.0407,0.0632,0.0155,0.0222,0.0162,0.0188,0.0208,0.0486,0.4104,0.0241,0.0175",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5730288/pexels-photo-5730288.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite frame covered with synthetic sailcloth to form a wing. Typically the pilot is in a harness suspended from the airframe, and controls the aircraft by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame.
Early hang gliders had a low lift-to-drag ratio, so pilots were restricted to gliding down small hills. By the 1980s this ratio significantly improved, and since then pilots can soar for hours, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of kilometers. The Federation Aeronautique Internationale and national airspace governing organisations control some regulatory aspects of hang gliding. Obtaining the safety benefits of being instructed is highly recommended and indeed a mandatory requirement in many countries.","Adventure Travel,Air Sports,Aircraft Configurations,All Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From May 2017,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From November 2010,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From August 2012,Articles With Unsourced Statements From December 2019,Cs1 Errors: Bare Url,Cs1 Errors: Missing Title,Commons Link Is On Wikidata,Glider Aircraft,Hang Gliding,Individual Sports,Outdoor Recreation,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From March 2021,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers",Hang gliding,Дельтапланеризм,"0.0195,0.0213,0.0395,0.0195,0.0195,0.0647,0.0221,0.0577,0.0317,0.0378,0.0464,0.2878,0.0586,0.0282,0.0282,0.0508,0.0412,0.0369,0.0647,0.0239",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6957265/pexels-photo-6957265.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The phenomenon of giving a high value to ancient artifacts is found in other cultures, notably China, where Chinese ritual bronzes, three to two thousand years old, have been avidly collected and imitated for centuries, and the Pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica, where in particular the artifacts of the earliest Olmec civilization are found reburied in significant sites of later cultures up to the Spanish Conquest.A person who studies antiquities, as opposed to just collecting them, is often called an antiquarian.","All Articles With Dead External Links,Ancient Art,Archaeological Artifacts,Art And Cultural Repatriation,Articles With Dead External Links From June 2016,Cs1 Errors: Bare Url,Cs1 Errors: Missing Title,Visual Arts Genres,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers",Antiquities,Древности,"0.06,0.0259,0.0424,0.0457,0.0402,0.0358,0.0314,0.027,0.0358,0.0259,0.027,0.0259,0.313,0.027,0.0281,0.0567,0.0292,0.0347,0.038,0.0512",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3739059/pexels-photo-3739059.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
434,rugby,Rugby football,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football,"Rugby is a collective name for the family of team sports of rugby union and rugby league, as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games, as well as Australian rules football and gridiron football, evolved. 
The two variants of gridiron football — Canadian football and, to a lesser extent, American football — were once considered forms of rugby football but are seldom now referred to as such. In fact, the governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union or league.Rugby football was thought to have been started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times (see medieval football). Rugby split into two sports in 1895, when twenty-one clubs split from the Rugby Football Union to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, over broken-time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players. Rugby union turned professional one hundred years later in 1995, following the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. The respective world governing bodies are World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league).
Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to these two codes, both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby football in the beginning of the 20th century.","All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From December 2012,Articles With Unsourced Statements From January 2013,Articles With Unsourced Statements From May 2013,Cs1: Julian–Gregorian Uncertainty,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Games And Sports Introduced In The 19Th Century,Rugby School,Rugby Football,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Team Sports,Use British English From August 2010,Use Dmy Dates From May 2020,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nkc Identifiers,Wikipedia Indefinitely Move-Protected Pages",Rugby,Регби,"0.0217,0.0202,0.0217,0.0445,0.024,0.0552,0.0186,0.043,0.0278,0.0247,0.0369,0.0209,0.0559,0.0301,0.027,0.0255,0.0209,0.3512,0.0605,0.0696",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3645005/pexels-photo-3645005.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

436,board sports,Boardsport,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boardsport,"Boardsports are sports that are played with some sort of board as the primary equipment. These sports take place on a variety of terrain, from paved flat-ground and snow-covered hills to water and air. Most boardsports are considered action sports or extreme sports, and thus often appeal to youth. A large proportion of youth partaking in these sports, together with aesthetic damage to property from sports like skateboarding, has led to many board sports being marginalized by the greater world of sports in the past. However, many board sports are ever-more frequently gaining mainstream recognition, and with this recognition have enjoyed wider broadcast, sponsorship and inclusion in institutional sporting events, including the Olympic Games.Surfing was the first boardsport, originating from Polynesian culture. Skateboarding was then invented by surfers looking to ""surf"" on land. It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were ""invented"" because people have been making homemade versions throughout history. For example, it is not hard to conceive of a person, who is familiar with the concept of skiing or sledding, standing sideways on a plank of wood and riding down a snow-covered slope. M.J. ""Jack"" Burchett is credited with first doing this in 1929, using horse reins and clothesline to secure his feet on the plank of wood. Most boardsports have similar, equally unknown origins.
Using data collected in the past decade, it is estimated there are 18-50 million skateboarders, 5-25 million surfers, and 10-20 million snowboarders in the world. Approximately 100 million people participate in boardsports worldwide.","All Articles Lacking Reliable References,All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Style Issues,Articles Lacking Reliable References From November 2013,Articles Needing Additional References From March 2009,Articles With Multiple Maintenance Issues,Articles With Short Description,Boardsports,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Individual Sports,Outdoor Recreation,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Sports By Type,Transport Culture,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Style Issues From March 2009",Board sports,Бордспорт,"0.025,0.0175,0.0285,0.0319,0.0484,0.0408,0.0243,0.0586,0.0202,0.0189,0.3124,0.0401,0.0291,0.0202,0.0326,0.0312,0.0237,0.0586,0.0525,0.0854",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5622331/pexels-photo-5622331.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
437,world news or politics,World news,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_news,"World news or international news or even foreign coverage is the news media jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet.
Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and ""national"" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.
At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenbüttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.
From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA, Germany) and the AP (US).
War journalism is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).","Journalism By Field,News,World",World news or politics,Всемирные новости или политика,"0.0707,0.105,0.0208,0.0429,0.0208,0.0217,0.0674,0.0641,0.0266,0.0445,0.0217,0.0298,0.0298,0.0184,0.0306,0.0315,0.02,0.02,0.2578,0.056",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2431401/pexels-photo-2431401.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

439,kite flying,Kite,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite,"A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces. A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it. Some kite designs don’t need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. One technical definition is that a kite is “a collection of tether-coupled wing sets“. The name derives from its resemblance to a hovering bird.The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air moves around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached. The anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving (e.g., the towing of a kite by a running person, boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle).The same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids, so kites can be used in underwater currents, but there are no everyday uses as yet.Man-lifting kites were made for reconnaissance, entertainment and during development of the first practical aircraft, the biplane.
Kites have a long and varied history and many different types are flown individually and at festivals worldwide. Kites may be flown for recreation, art or other practical uses. Sport kites can be flown in aerial ballet, sometimes as part of a competition. Power kites are multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which can be used to power activities such as kite surfing, kite landboarding, kite buggying and snow kiting.","Aircraft Configurations,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From November 2020,Cs1 Korean-Language Sources (Ko),Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Cs1 Maint: Location,Commons Link Is On Wikidata,Desi Culture,Indonesian Inventions,Kites,Physical Activity And Dexterity Toys,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Traditional Toys,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles Needing Clarification From August 2012,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers",Kite flying,Воздушный змей,"0.0192,0.0163,0.0507,0.0232,0.0266,0.0358,0.0209,0.0369,0.0209,0.3405,0.0558,0.1148,0.0221,0.0175,0.0232,0.014,0.1005,0.0203,0.0272,0.0135",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1599917/pexels-photo-1599917.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
440,knitting,Knitting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitting,"Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile or fabric. It is used in many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine.
Knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round (tubular). There are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows.  As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.
Differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist), needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity. A small sample of knitwork is known as a swatch.","All Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements,All Articles With Dead External Links,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From May 2020,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles With Dead External Links From February 2020,Articles With Permanently Dead External Links,Articles With Short Description,Commons Category Link From Wikidata,Crafts,Fibers,Handicrafts,Knitting,Sheep Wool,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From October 2017,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Woolen Clothing",Knitting,Вязание,"0.0255,0.0313,0.0606,0.0196,0.0205,0.0472,0.023,0.0205,0.0263,0.0246,0.0597,0.0246,0.0338,0.0213,0.4114,0.0263,0.028,0.0272,0.0238,0.0447",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2399125/pexels-photo-2399125.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

442,pottery,Pottery,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery,"Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard, durable form.   Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural ""potteries"").  The definition of pottery used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), is ""all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products."" In archaeology, especially of ancient and prehistoric periods, ""pottery"" often means vessels only, and figures of the same material are called ""terracottas.""  Clay as a part of the materials used is required by some definitions of pottery, but this is dubious.

Pottery is one of the oldest human inventions, originating before the Neolithic period, with ceramic objects like the Gravettian culture Venus of Dolní Věstonice figurine discovered in the Czech Republic dating back to 29,000–25,000 BC, and pottery vessels that were discovered in Jiangxi, China, which date back to 18,000 BC.  Early Neolithic and pre-Neolithic pottery artifacts have been found, in Jōmon Japan (10,500 BC), the Russian Far East (14,000 BC), Sub-Saharan Africa (9,400 BC), South America (9,000s-7,000s BC), and the Middle East (7,000s-6,000s BC).
Pottery is made by forming a ceramic (often clay) body into objects of a desired shape and heating them to high temperatures (600-1600 °C) in a bonfire, pit or kiln and induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing the strength and rigidity of the object.  Much pottery is purely utilitarian, but much can also be regarded as ceramic art.  A clay body can be decorated before or after firing.

Clay-based pottery can be divided into three main groups: earthenware, stoneware and porcelain.  These require increasingly more specific clay material, and increasingly higher firing temperatures. All three are made in glazed and unglazed varieties, for different purposes.  All may also be decorated by various techniques. In many examples the group a piece belongs to is immediately visually apparent, but this is not always the case.  The fritware of the Islamic world does not use clay, so technically falls outside these groups.  Historic pottery of all these types is often grouped as either ""fine"" wares, relatively expensive and well-made, and following the aesthetic taste of the culture concerned, or alternatively ""coarse"", ""popular"", ""folk"" or ""village"" wares, mostly undecorated, or simply so, and often less well-made.","All Articles With Dead External Links,All Articles With Links Needing Disambiguation,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles With Dead External Links From August 2017,Articles With Links Needing Disambiguation From July 2021,Articles With Permanently Dead External Links,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Cs1 Maint: Bot: Original Url Status Unknown,Cs1 Maint: Multiple Names: Authors List,Ceramic Art,Ceramics,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Pages Using Multiple Image With Auto Scaled Images,Pottery,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Types Of Production,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers",Pottery,Гончарное производство,"0.026,0.0182,0.025,0.0284,0.041,0.0158,0.0124,0.023,0.0313,0.024,0.0289,0.0167,0.5471,0.0138,0.0381,0.0167,0.025,0.0187,0.0197,0.0303",https://images.pexels.com/photos/716107/pexels-photo-716107.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
443,judo,Judo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo,"Judo (柔道, jūdō, Japanese pronunciation: [dʑɯꜜːdoː], lit. ""gentle way"") is generally categorized as a modern Japanese martial art, which has since evolved into an Olympic event. The sport was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano (嘉納治五郎) as a physical, mental, and moral pedagogy in Japan. With its origins coming from jujutsu, judo's most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (kata, 形) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori, 乱取り). It was also referred to as Kanō Jiu-Jitsu until the introduction to the Olympic event. A judo practitioner is called a ""judoka"", and the judo uniform is called ""judogi"".
The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from koryū (古流, traditional schools). Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, Sambo and ARB. Judo also influenced other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.","All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing Japanese-Language Text,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From September 2012,Cs1 Maint: Location,Combat Sports,Dō,Gendai Budo,Grappling,Japanese Martial Arts,Judo,Mixed Martial Arts Styles,Official Website Not In Wikidata,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Hidden Wikidata,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Wikidata Mismatch,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Wikidata Namespace Mismatch,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Sport In Japan,Sports Originating In Japan,Summer Olympic Sports,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers",Judo,Дзюдо,"0.047,0.022,0.0551,0.022,0.0632,0.0524,0.2164,0.0273,0.0524,0.0202,0.0381,0.0354,0.0596,0.0211,0.022,0.0264,0.0542,0.1151,0.0264,0.0237",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7045741/pexels-photo-7045741.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
444,jet engines,Jet engine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine,"A jet engine is a type of reaction engine discharging a fast-moving jet that generates thrust by jet propulsion. While this broad definition can include rocket, water jet, and hybrid propulsion, the term jet engine typically refers to an internal combustion airbreathing jet engine such as a turbojet, turbofan, ramjet, or pulse jet. In general, jet engines are internal combustion engines.
Airbreathing jet engines typically feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine, with the leftover power providing thrust through the propelling nozzle—this process is known as the Brayton thermodynamic cycle. Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel. Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines that were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight. Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines.  They give higher speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances. A few air-breathing engines made for high speed applications (ramjets and scramjets) use the ram effect of the vehicle's speed instead of a mechanical compressor.
The thrust of a typical jetliner engine went from 5,000 lbf (22,000 N) (de Havilland Ghost turbojet) in the 1950s to 115,000 lbf (510,000 N) (General Electric GE90 turbofan) in the 1990s, and their reliability went from 40 in-flight shutdowns per 100,000 engine flight hours to less than 1 per 100,000 in the late 1990s. This, combined with greatly decreased fuel consumption, permitted routine transatlantic flight by twin-engined airliners by the turn of the century, where previously a similar journey would have required multiple fuel stops.","20Th-Century Inventions,Aerodynamics,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From April 2010,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Commons Category Link From Wikidata,Discovery And Invention Controversies,Energy Conversion,Engineering Thermodynamics,Fluid Dynamics,Gas Compressors,Gas Turbines,Jet Engines,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Turbomachinery,Use Oxford Spelling From September 2016,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating Text From The Federal Aviation Administration,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers",Jet Engines,Реактивные двигатели,"0.0153,0.0203,0.0509,0.0147,0.0265,0.0259,0.0197,0.0602,0.0147,0.0702,0.0353,0.451,0.024,0.0165,0.0215,0.0159,0.049,0.0215,0.0147,0.0321",https://images.pexels.com/photos/372797/pexels-photo-372797.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
445,pets,Pet,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet,"A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.
Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats; the technical term for a cat lover is an ailurophile and a dog lover a cynophile. Other animals commonly kept include: rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents, such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; avian pets, such as parrots, passerines and fowls; reptile pets, such as turtles, alligators, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes; aquatic pets, such as fish, freshwater and saltwater snails, amphibians like frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets, such as tarantulas and hermit crabs. Small pets may be grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.
Pets provide their owners (or ""guardians"") both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive or emotional goals with patients.

People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property or because of the perceived beauty or attractiveness of the animals. A 1994 Canadian study found that the most common reasons for not owning a pet were lack of ability to care for the pet when traveling (34.6%), lack of time (28.6%) and lack of suitable housing (28.3%), with dislike of pets being less common (19.6%). Some scholars, ethicists and animal rights organizations have raised concerns over keeping pets because of the lack of autonomy and the objectification of non-human animals.","All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Animals And Humans,Articles Needing Additional References From May 2021,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From June 2020,Cs1 Dutch-Language Sources (Nl),Cs1 Maint: Multiple Names: Authors List,Cs1 Maint: Numeric Names: Authors List,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Pages Using Div Col With Small Parameter,Pets,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From June 2018,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bne Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lnb Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Pages Semi-Protected Against Vandalism",pets,Домашние питомцы,"0.0747,0.0237,0.0155,0.0308,0.0181,0.0166,0.0604,0.0538,0.014,0.0344,0.0145,0.013,0.0262,0.3764,0.0242,0.0645,0.0247,0.0242,0.015,0.0752",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1938123/pexels-photo-1938123.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

447,tie dying,Tie-dye,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-dye,"Tie-dye is a modern term invented in the mid-1960s in the United States (but recorded in writing in an earlier form in 1941 as ""tied-and-dyed"", and 1909 as ""tied and dyed"" by Charles E. Pellew, referenced below) for a set of ancient resist-dyeing techniques, and for the products of these processes. The process of tie-dye typically consists of folding, twisting, pleating, or crumpling fabric or a garment and binding with string or rubber bands, followed by application of dye(s). The manipulations of the fabric prior to the application of dye are called resists, as they partially or completely prevent the applied dye from coloring the fabric. More sophisticated tie-dyes involve additional steps, including an initial application of dye prior to the resist, multiple sequential dye and resist steps, and the use of other types of resists (stitching, stencils) and discharge.
Unlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become clichéd since the peak popularity of tie-dye in the 1960s and 1970s. The vast majority of currently produced tie-dyes use these designs, and many are mass-produced for wholesale distribution. However, a new interest in more 'sophisticated' tie-dye is emerging in the fashion industry, characterized by simple motifs, monochromatic color schemes, and a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton.  A few artists continue to pursue tie-dye as an art form rather than a commodity.","1960S Fads And Trends,1960S Fashion,1970S Fads And Trends,1970S Fashion,Articles Containing Japanese-Language Text,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Indonesian-Language Sources (Id),Cs1 Errors: Generic Title,Commons Category Link From Wikidata,Dyes,Hippie Movement,Pages Containing Links To Subscription-Only Content,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Textile Arts",Tie dying,Завязывание галстука,"0.0188,0.0489,0.0514,0.0316,0.0642,0.2398,0.0182,0.015,0.0431,0.0291,0.0169,0.0246,0.0297,0.0163,0.1676,0.0297,0.0686,0.0188,0.0335,0.0342",https://images.pexels.com/photos/937481/pexels-photo-937481.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

449,herping,Herping,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herping,"Herping is the act of searching for amphibians or reptiles.  The term, often used by professional and amateur herpetologists, comes from the word ""herp"", which comes from the same Greek root as herpetology, herpet-,  meaning ""creeping"". The term herp is a shorthand used to refer to the two classes of ectothermic tetrapods (i.e., amphibians and reptiles).Herping consists of many activities; anyone can find reptiles or amphibians while herping. The activity or technique depends on the terrain and target species. These include, but are not limited to, searching under natural cover objects (such as rocks and logs) and artificial cover objects (such as trash or construction debris), sometimes called 'flipping', as in 'flipping rocks' or 'flipping boards'; locating calling amphibians by ear, commonly done in pairs in order to triangulate on the location of the frog or toad; muddling or noodling for turtles by feeling around in mud or around objects submerged in water; dip-netting for aquatic amphibians and turtles; noosing lizards with wire or fishing line on the end of a pole; lantern walking, which involves searching habitat on foot at night; and road cruising, which refers to the practice of driving along a road slowly in search of reptiles or amphibians that are crossing the road or basking on the road surface.
General herping can take place any time, anywhere, whereas road herping or ""cruising"" usually takes place at dawn or dusk, or during rainstorms. Road cruising during rainstorms has a high probability of finding toads or frogs that may be otherwise impossible to find during normal conditions.","All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Style Issues,Articles Needing Additional References From December 2019,Herpetology,Wikipedia Articles With Style Issues From March 2011",Herping,Поиск земноводных или рептилий,"0.0163,0.022,0.0322,0.0495,0.0329,0.0361,0.0437,0.0335,0.022,0.0227,0.0514,0.0661,0.0635,0.2577,0.0201,0.0508,0.0897,0.0329,0.0201,0.0367",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5712683/pexels-photo-5712683.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

452,seashell collecting,Seashell,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seashell,"A seashell or sea shell, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually created by an animal that lives in the sea. The shell is part of the body of the animal. Empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers. The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have been eaten by another animal or have decomposed.
A seashell is usually the exoskeleton of an invertebrate (an animal without a backbone), and is typically composed of calcium carbonate or chitin. Most shells that are found on beaches are the shells of marine mollusks, partly because these shells are usually made of calcium carbonate, and endure better than shells made of chitin.
Apart from mollusk shells, other shells that can be found on beaches are those of barnacles, horseshoe crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The shells of sea urchins are called ""tests"", and the moulted shells of crabs and lobsters are exuviae. While most seashells are external, some cephalopods have internal shells.
Seashells have been used by humans for many different purposes throughout history and prehistory. However, seashells are not the only kind of shells; in various habitats, there are shells from freshwater animals such as freshwater mussels and freshwater snails, and shells of land snails.","All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Needing Additional References From December 2017,Articles Needing Additional References From January 2009,Articles Needing Additional References From July 2016,Articles Needing Additional References From September 2011,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From February 2011,Cs1: Long Volume Value,Collecting,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Mollusc Products,Mollusc Shells,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From September 2020,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Zoology",Seashell collecting,Коллекционирование ракушек,"0.0245,0.0198,0.0524,0.0245,0.0237,0.0175,0.0198,0.0253,0.0462,0.0214,0.0198,0.0198,0.0276,0.3998,0.0524,0.0423,0.0183,0.0346,0.0929,0.0175",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4997903/pexels-photo-4997903.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered by property owners and civic authorities as defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime, citing the use of graffiti by street gangs to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities. Graffiti has become visualized as a growing urban ""problem"" for many cities in industrialized nations, spreading from the New York City subway system in the early 1970s to the rest of the United States and Europe and other world regions.","All Npov Disputes,All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles That May Contain Original Research,All Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing Greek-Language Text,Articles Needing Additional References From March 2009,Articles That May Contain Original Research From March 2019,Articles With Multiple Maintenance Issues,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From March 2019,Articles With Unsourced Statements From July 2018,Articles With Unsourced Statements From October 2015,Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Portuguese-Language Sources (Pt),Commons Link Is On Wikidata,Graffiti And Unauthorised Signage,Npov Disputes From March 2019,Organized Crime Activity,Painting Techniques,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Street Culture,Visual Arts Genres,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating A Citation From The New International Encyclopedia,Wikipedia Articles Needing Clarification From June 2018,Wikipedia Articles Needing Clarification From October 2014,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Indefinitely Semi-Protected Pages,Writing",Graffiti,Граффити,"0.0941,0.0283,0.0365,0.053,0.0427,0.0231,0.0293,0.0252,0.0334,0.0345,0.0427,0.0396,0.1353,0.0324,0.0849,0.052,0.0273,0.0262,0.0643,0.0952",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4551851/pexels-photo-4551851.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

459,wildlife,Wildlife,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife,"Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.
Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event. According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.","All Articles With Self-Published Sources,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing Arabic-Language Text,Articles With Self-Published Sources From July 2010,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From November 2015,Articles With Unsourced Statements From October 2019,Pages With Too Many Photos,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles Needing Clarification From July 2012,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wildlife",Wildlife,Дикая природа,"0.0371,0.0446,0.0147,0.0621,0.0446,0.0159,0.0184,0.0571,0.0184,0.0159,0.0259,0.0197,0.0409,0.3262,0.0253,0.0278,0.0172,0.0172,0.1326,0.0384",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7003062/pexels-photo-7003062.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

This performance art form takes place not only in gentleman's clubs as erotic dance, but also as a mainstream form of fitness, practiced in gyms and dedicated dance studios. Pole dancing enthusiasts are of all ages; although many who perform this dance and acrobatic form are adults, that does not stop younger children from learning and performing in competitions. Amateur and professional pole dancing competitions are held in countries around the world.
Pole dance requires significant muscular endurance and coordination, as well as sensuality. Today, pole performances by exotic dancers range from basic spins and striptease in more intimate clubs to athletic moves such as climbs and body inversions in the ""stage heavy"" clubs of Las Vegas and Miami. Dancer Remy Redd at the King of Diamonds, for example, is famous for flipping herself upside down into a split and hanging from the ceiling. Pole dance requires significant strength and flexibility. Upper body and core strength are required to attain proficiency, and proper instruction and rigorous training are necessary. Since the mid-2000s, promoters of pole dance fitness competitions have tried to change peoples' perception of pole dance to include pole fitness as a non-sexual form of dance and acrobatics and are trying to move pole into the Olympics as pole sports.
Pole dance is regarded as a form of exercise which can be used as both an aerobic and anaerobic workout. Recognized schools and qualifications are now commonplace.","All Articles That Are Excessively Detailed,All Articles With Style Issues,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From April 2017,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Dance Equipment,Erotic Dance,Exercise Equipment,Gymnastics,Physical Exercise,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Use British English From September 2020,Use Dmy Dates From August 2019,Wikipedia Articles Needing Clarification From November 2018,Wikipedia Articles That Are Excessively Detailed From July 2019,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Style Issues From July 2019",Pole Dancing,Танцы с шестом,"0.0325,0.0233,0.0161,0.0299,0.0214,0.287,0.0279,0.0437,0.0161,0.0746,0.1417,0.0174,0.0227,0.0378,0.0174,0.0293,0.0371,0.0569,0.0358,0.0312",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3170082/pexels-photo-3170082.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The governing body of Squash, the World Squash Federation (WSF), is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but the sport is not part of the Olympic Games, despite a number of applications. Supporters continue to lobby for its incorporation in a future Olympic program.","Articles With Curlie Links,Articles With Short Description,Ball Games,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Default Search,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Hidden Wikidata,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Wikidata Namespace Mismatch,Racquet Sports,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Sports Originating In England,Squash (Sport),Wall And Ball Games,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers",Squash,Сквош,"0.0243,0.0372,0.0361,0.0264,0.0254,0.0372,0.0394,0.0448,0.0448,0.0307,0.0545,0.0383,0.0243,0.0318,0.0545,0.0286,0.0383,0.2875,0.0318,0.0642",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1277483/pexels-photo-1277483.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
462,bowling,Bowling,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling,"Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins (in pin bowling) or another target (in target bowling). The term bowling usually refers to pin bowling (most commonly ten-pin bowling), though in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, bowling could also refer to target bowling, such as lawn bowls.
In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins on a long playing surface known as a lane. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll.
Lanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that vary ball path trajectories and characteristics. Common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, candlepin, duckpin, nine-pin, five-pin and kegel. The historical game skittles is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.
In target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible.  The surface in target bowling may be grass, gravel, or synthetic.  Lawn bowls, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque, and boules may have both indoor and outdoor varieties.
Bowling is played by 100 million people in more than 90 countries (including 70 million in the United States alone), and is the subject of video games.","All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles That Are Excessively Detailed,All Articles With Style Issues,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,All Pages Needing Cleanup,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles Needing Additional References From January 2019,Articles Needing Cleanup From December 2020,Articles With Multiple Maintenance Issues,Articles With Sections That Need To Be Turned Into Prose From December 2020,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From August 2018,Ball Games,Bowling,Cs1: Julian–Gregorian Uncertainty,Commons Link From Wikidata,Egyptian Inventions,Individual Sports,Pages Using Multiple Image With Auto Scaled Images,Precision Sports,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Team Sports,Throwing Games,Throwing Sports,Use Dmy Dates From April 2019,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating A Citation From The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica With Wikisource Reference,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating Text From The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica,Wikipedia Articles That Are Excessively Detailed From December 2020,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Style Issues From December 2020",Bowling,Боулинг,"0.0228,0.0266,0.0274,0.0305,0.0513,0.0297,0.0181,0.0475,0.0204,0.0413,0.0374,0.0714,0.0189,0.0305,0.0799,0.0258,0.0258,0.3445,0.0235,0.0266",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2095724/pexels-photo-2095724.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
463,polo,Polo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo,"Polo is a horseback ball game, a traditional field sport and one of the world's oldest known team sports. The game is played by two opposing teams with the objective of scoring using a long-handled wooden mallet to hit a small hard ball through the opposing team's goal. Each team has four mounted riders, and the game usually lasts one to two hours, divided into periods called chukkas or ""chukkers"".
Polo has been called ""the sport of kings"", and has become a spectator sport for equestrians and high society, often supported by sponsorship.  The concept of the game and its variants date back from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD, originated from equestrian games played by nomadic Iranian peoples. The sport was at first a training game for Persian cavalry units, usually the royal guard or other elite troops. A notable example is Saladin, who was known for being a skilled polo player which contributed to his cavalry training. It is now popular around the world, with well over 100 member countries in the Federation of International Polo, played professionally in 16 countries, and was an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1936.
Arena polo is an indoor/semi-outdoor variant with similar rules, and is played with three riders per team. The playing field is smaller, enclosed and usually of compacted sand or fine aggregate, and often indoors. Arena polo has more maneuvering due to space limitations, and uses an air-inflated ball slightly larger than the hard solid ball used in field polo. Standard mallets are used, though slightly larger-head arena mallets are an option.","All Articles With Dead External Links,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Dead External Links From September 2018,Articles With Permanently Dead External Links,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From January 2021,Articles With Unsourced Statements From June 2020,Articles With Unsourced Statements From May 2014,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Former Summer Olympic Sports,Polo,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Use British English From January 2012,Use Dmy Dates From May 2020,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers",Polo,Поло,"0.0234,0.0206,0.0422,0.0213,0.0415,0.0372,0.0509,0.0415,0.0458,0.0639,0.0278,0.0263,0.0278,0.0307,0.04,0.0184,0.022,0.3373,0.048,0.0335",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3723103/pexels-photo-3723103.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
464,cloud watching,Cloud,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud,"In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space. Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.
They are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.  There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common.
Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names due to the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802.  It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera. The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratus, cirrus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.  Low-level  clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes.  However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-. Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes.  They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical.   Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names.
In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types. They may have the appearance of  stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water.
Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth.  They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect.  The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere.  Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change. Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.","Articles Containing Old English (Ca. 450-1100)-Language Text,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Errors: Missing Periodical,Cs1 Maint: Multiple Names: Authors List,Clouds,Clouds,Fog And Precipitation,Good Articles,Harv And Sfn No-Target Errors,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Default Search,Pages With Numeric Bible Version References,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From March 2020,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Pending Changes Protected Pages",Cloud Watching,Наблюдать за облаками,"0.0099,0.0172,0.0515,0.037,0.0095,0.0212,0.0115,0.0139,0.0115,0.0382,0.0341,0.0091,0.0115,0.0236,0.0778,0.0127,0.0588,0.0139,0.5246,0.0123",https://images.pexels.com/photos/2682677/pexels-photo-2682677.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
465,musical instruments,Musical instrument,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument,"A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. A person who plays a musical instrument is known as an instrumentalist. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for rituals, such as a horn to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.
The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible, as many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.
Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the post-classical era, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans played instruments originating from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. 
By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident. During the Classical and Romantic periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, many new musical instruments were developed. While the evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the 20th century, the proliferation of electricity led to the invention of new electric instruments, such as electric guitars, synthesizers and the theremin.
Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, material composition, size, role, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel–Sachs, uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.","Articles With Short Description,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Good Articles,Musical Instruments,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From April 2015,Wikipedia Articles With Bne Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers",Musical Instruments,Музыкальные инструменты,"0.0304,0.0174,0.0665,0.0694,0.0228,0.0334,0.0269,0.0222,0.1522,0.0139,0.0192,0.0157,0.2999,0.0559,0.0222,0.0352,0.0151,0.0269,0.0198,0.0352",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6966/abstract-music-rock-bw.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend.""","All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Animal Models,""Articles With Species Microformats"",Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From May 2021,Cs1: Long Volume Value,Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Latin-Language Sources (La),Cs1 Errors: Extra Text: Volume,Cs1 Maint: Extra Text: Authors List,Cs1 Maint: Uses Authors Parameter,Cosmopolitan Species,Cosmopolitan Vertebrates,Dogs,Domesticated Animals,Extant Late Pleistocene First Appearances,Mammals Described In 1758,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Default Search,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Hidden Wikidata,Pages Using Multiple Image With Auto Scaled Images,Scavengers,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Taxa Named By Carl Linnaeus,Taxonbars Desynced From Wikidata,Taxonbars On Possible Non-Taxon Pages,Taxonbars Using Multiple Manual Wikidata Items,Use Dmy Dates From September 2018,Wikipedia Articles Needing Page Number Citations From May 2021,Wikipedia Articles With Bne Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Hds Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Indefinitely Move-Protected Pages,Wikipedia Indefinitely Semi-Protected Pages,Wolves",Dogs,Собаки,"0.1016,0.0239,0.0212,0.0402,0.0221,0.0294,0.0556,0.0528,0.0248,0.0366,0.0266,0.0212,0.0303,0.2814,0.0393,0.0303,0.023,0.023,0.0655,0.051",https://images.pexels.com/photos/406014/pexels-photo-406014.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
467,drummer,Drummer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer,"A drummer is a percussionist who creates music using drums.
Most contemporary western bands that play rock, pop, jazz, or R&B music include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. The drummer's equipment includes a drum kit (or ""drum set"" or ""trap set"") which includes various drums, cymbals and an assortment of accessory hardware such as pedals, standing support mechanisms, and drum sticks.
Particularly in the traditional music of many countries, drummers use individual drums of various sizes and designs rather than drum kits. Some use only their hands to strike the drums.In larger ensembles, the drummer may be part of a rhythm section with other percussionists playing, for example, vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. These musicians provide the timing and rhythmic foundation which allow the players of melodic instruments, including voices, to coordinate their musical performance.
Some famous drummers include: Max Roach, Ringo Starr, John Bonham, Ginger Baker, Keith Moon (The Who), Neil Peart, Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Tim ""Herb"" Alexander (Primus), Phil Rudd (AC/DC), Rashied Ali, Carl Allen, Steve White, Craig Blundell, Travis Barker, Tony Royster Jr., Rick Allen (Def Leppard), Tré Cool (Green Day), Dave Grohl (Nirvana), Zac Hanson (Hanson (band)), Ashton Irwin (Five Seconds of Summer) and Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe).
As well as the primary rhythmic function, in some musical styles, such as world, jazz, classical, and electronica, the drummer is called upon to provide solo and lead performances, at times when the main feature of the music is the rhythmic development.
There are many tools that a drummer can use for either timekeeping or soloing.
These include cymbals (china, crash, ride, splash, hi-hats, etc.), snare, toms, 
auxiliary percussion (bells, Latin drums, cowbells, temple blocks) and many others.
Also there are single, double, and triple bass pedals for the bass drum.","All Wikipedia Articles In Need Of Updating,All Articles Needing Additional References,Articles Needing Additional References From August 2011,Articles With Multiple Maintenance Issues,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Drummers,Drumming,Military Ranks Of The British Army,Occupations In Music,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Wikipedia Articles In Need Of Updating From August 2011,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating A Citation From The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica With Wikisource Reference,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Multiple Identifiers",drummer,Играть на барабанах,"0.0413,0.0322,0.0166,0.0205,0.025,0.064,0.0179,0.0439,0.398,0.0192,0.0445,0.0289,0.0283,0.0211,0.0458,0.0159,0.0296,0.0393,0.038,0.0302",https://images.pexels.com/photos/6957258/pexels-photo-6957258.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
468,video game,Video game,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game,"A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.
Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s are simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game is the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The quickly-growing industry suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles. 
In the 2000s, the core industry centered around ""triple-A"" blockbuster games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the size of the 2019 global music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.","American Inventions,Articles Prone To Spam From October 2013,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Maint: Unfit Url,Digital Media,Games And Sports Introduced In 1947,Pages Using Sister Project Links With Default Search,Pages Using Multiple Image With Auto Scaled Images,Pages With Non-Numeric Formatnum Arguments,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From January 2020,Video Games,Webarchive Template Other Archives,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nkc Identifiers,Wikipedia Pages Semi-Protected Against Vandalism",video game,Компьютерные игры,"0.0162,0.6481,0.0143,0.0105,0.0152,0.0209,0.0321,0.0129,0.0321,0.0124,0.0124,0.0176,0.0134,0.0176,0.0284,0.0105,0.0134,0.0326,0.0284,0.011",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4148891/pexels-photo-4148891.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
469,phonograph record,Phonograph record,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record,"A phonograph disc record (also known as a gramophone disc record, especially in British English), or simply a phonograph record, gramophone record, disc record or record, is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc. At first, the discs were commonly made from shellac, with earlier records having a fine abrasive filler mixed in. Starting in the 1940s polyvinyl chloride became common, hence the name ""vinyl"". In the mid-2000s, gradually, records made of any material began to be called vinyl disc records, also known as vinyl records or vinyl for short.
The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991. Since the 1990s, records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale, and during the 1990s and early 2000s were commonly used by disc jockeys (DJs), especially in dance music genres. They were also listened to by a growing number of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence as a format for rock music in the early 21st century—9.2 million records were sold in the US in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009. Likewise, sales in the UK increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014.As of 2017, 48 record pressing facilities remain worldwide, 18 in the US and 30 in other countries. The increased popularity of the record has led to the investment in new and modern record-pressing machines. Only two producers of lacquers (acetate discs or master discs) remain: Apollo Masters in California, and MDC in Japan. On February 6, 2020, a fire destroyed the Apollo Masters plant. According to the Apollo Masters website, their future is still uncertain.Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch) (although they were designed in millimeters), the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) at which they are played (8+1⁄3, 16+2⁄3, 33+1⁄3, 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP [long playing], 12-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 rpm; SP [single], 10-inch disc, 78 rpm, or 7-inch disc, 45 rpm; EP [extended play], 12-inch disc or 7-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 or 45 rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc.); and the number of audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).
The phrase broken record refers to a malfunction when the needle skips/jumps back to the previous groove and plays the same section over and over again indefinitely.The large cover (and inner sleeves) are valued by collectors and artists for the space given for visual expression, especially in the case of 12-inch discs.","1894 In Music,All Wikipedia Articles In Need Of Updating,All Articles Lacking Reliable References,All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Dead External Links,All Articles With Failed Verification,All Articles With Incomplete Citations,All Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing German-Language Text,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles Lacking Reliable References From February 2019,Articles Needing Additional References From November 2019,Articles With Dead External Links From January 2017,Articles With Failed Verification From February 2019,Articles With Haudio Microformats,Articles With Incomplete Citations From March 2019,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From July 2019,Articles With Unsourced Statements From April 2017,Articles With Unsourced Statements From December 2019,Articles With Unsourced Statements From March 2018,Articles With Unsourced Statements From October 2019,Articles With Unsourced Statements From September 2012,Audio Storage,Audiovisual Introductions In 1894,Cs1 French-Language Sources (Fr),Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Location Test,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Hip Hop Production,Recorded Music,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Turntablism,Use Dmy Dates From May 2021,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles In Need Of Updating From April 2018,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nkc Identifiers",phonograph record,Виниловые пластинки,"0.0122,0.1126,0.0118,0.0114,0.0182,0.0427,0.0281,0.0139,0.0624,0.3233,0.0341,0.0384,0.086,0.0195,0.0277,0.0384,0.0169,0.0281,0.0315,0.0427",https://images.pexels.com/photos/3693108/pexels-photo-3693108.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

The 1939 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, Leopold Ružička stated in 1945 that ""right from the earliest days of scientific chemistry up to the present time perfumes have substantially contributed to the development of organic chemistry as regards methods, systematic
classification, and theory.""Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics.","All Articles With Self-Published Sources,All Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Containing French-Language Text,Articles With Long Short Description,Articles With Self-Published Sources From December 2017,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From July 2015,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From October 2020,Articles With Unsourced Statements From April 2008,Articles With Unsourced Statements From June 2019,Articles With Unsourced Statements From September 2017,Cosmetics,Pages Using Div Col With Small Parameter,Perfumery,Perfumes,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Toiletry,Use Dmy Dates From February 2019,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia External Links Cleanup From October 2020,Wikipedia Spam Cleanup From October 2020",Perfume,Парфюм,"0.0459,0.0333,0.101,0.0903,0.0517,0.042,0.0382,0.0478,0.0469,0.0217,0.0237,0.0246,0.1222,0.1048,0.0333,0.0246,0.0382,0.0227,0.0488,0.0382",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4659793/pexels-photo-4659793.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
471,black metal,Black metal,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal,"Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.
During the 1980s, several thrash metal and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal. This ""first wave"" included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon and Gorgoroth. The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave, the second generation in Sweden being led by Dissection, Abruptum, Marduk, and Nifelheim.Initially a synonym for ""Satanic metal"", black metal has often sparked controversy, due to the actions and ideologies associated with the genre. Some artists express misanthropic views, and others advocating various forms of extreme anti-Christian sentiment, Satanism, or ethnic paganism. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murders. There is also a small neo-Nazi movement within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists. Generally, black metal strives to remain an underground phenomenon.","1980S In Music,1990S In Music,2000S In Music,2010S In Music,20Th-Century Music Genres,21St-Century Music Genres,Articles With Short Description,Black Metal,British Rock Music Genres,Cs1 Finnish-Language Sources (Fi),Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Norwegian-Language Sources (No),Cs1 Russian-Language Sources (Ru),Cs1 Swedish-Language Sources (Sv),Cs1 Errors: Missing Periodical,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Dynamic Lists,European Culture,Extreme Metal,Heavy Metal Genres,Norwegian Styles Of Music,Obscenity Controversies In Music,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Use Dmy Dates From June 2019,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles Needing Time Reference Citations From October 2018",Black metal,Блэк-метал,"0.0295,0.0163,0.0969,0.0622,0.0455,0.1247,0.0295,0.0184,0.1267,0.026,0.0524,0.0233,0.0337,0.0205,0.0219,0.0385,0.033,0.0184,0.1122,0.0705",https://images.pexels.com/photos/352505/pexels-photo-352505.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
472,cats,Cat,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat,"The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC. It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt. As of 2021 there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.","All Wikipedia Articles Written In American English,All Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Animal Models,Articles Containing Ancient Egyptian-Language Text,Articles Containing Ancient Greek (To 1453)-Language Text,Articles Containing Arabic-Language Text,Articles Containing Coptic-Language Text,Articles Containing Dutch-Language Text,Articles Containing Hungarian-Language Text,Articles Containing Irish-Language Text,Articles Containing Japanese-Language Text,Articles Containing Latin-Language Text,Articles Containing Lithuanian-Language Text,Articles Containing Low German-Language Text,Articles Containing Northern Sami-Language Text,Articles Containing Norwegian-Language Text,Articles Containing Old English (Ca. 450-1100)-Language Text,Articles Containing Swedish-Language Text,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From 2017,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From 2020,Articles Containing Potentially Dated Statements From 2021,Articles Containing Video Clips,""Articles With Species Microformats"",Articles With Haudio Microformats,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Text In Nubian Languages,Articles With Unsourced Statements From September 2020,Cs1: Long Volume Value,Cs1 Arabic-Language Sources (Ar),Cs1 French-Language Sources (Fr),Cs1 Latin-Language Sources (La),Cs1 Portuguese-Language Sources (Pt),Cs1 Spanish-Language Sources (Es),Cs1 Errors: Extra Text: Volume,Cats,Commons Link Is On Wikidata,Cosmopolitan Mammals,Cosmopolitan Vertebrates,Domesticated Animals,Felis,Good Articles,Mammals Described In 1758,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Spoken Articles,Taxa Named By Carl Linnaeus,Taxonbars Desynced From Wikidata,Taxonbars On Possible Non-Taxon Pages,Use American English From January 2020,Use Dmy Dates From July 2021,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating A Citation From The Encyclopedia Americana With A Wikisource Reference,Wikipedia Articles Needing Page Number Citations From November 2014,Wikipedia Articles With Bne Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Hds Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Multiple Identifiers,Wikipedia Indefinitely Move-Protected Pages,Wikipedia Indefinitely Semi-Protected Pages",Cats,Кошки,"0.0498,0.0166,0.0509,0.0368,0.0177,0.0253,0.0308,0.0172,0.0177,0.0231,0.034,0.0286,0.0221,0.5084,0.034,0.0155,0.0155,0.0182,0.0182,0.0193",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4602/jumping-cute-playing-animals.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

U.S. academic environments define leadership as ""a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task"".  Others have challenged the more traditional managerial view of leadership which believes that it is something possessed or owned by one individual due to their role or authority, and instead advocate the complex nature of leadership which is found at all levels of the institution, both within formal  roles.Studies of leadership have produced theories involving traits, situational interaction, function, behavior, power, vision and values, charisma, and intelligence, among others.","All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Dead External Links,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles Needing Additional References From February 2013,Articles Needing Additional References From September 2009,Articles With Dead External Links From December 2017,Articles With Permanently Dead External Links,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From April 2021,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From May 2019,Articles With Specifically Marked Weasel-Worded Phrases From May 2020,Articles With Unsourced Statements From August 2014,Articles With Unsourced Statements From May 2020,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Commons Category Link From Wikidata,Industrial And Organizational Psychology,Leadership,Majority–Minority Relations,Political Science Terminology,Social Concepts,Strategic Management,Wikipedia Articles Needing Factual Verification From April 2021,Wikipedia Articles Needing Factual Verification From May 2020,Wikipedia Articles Needing Page Number Citations From May 2020,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ndl Identifiers",Leadership,Лидерство,"0.2822,0.0244,0.0218,0.0733,0.0689,0.0209,0.0964,0.0209,0.0298,0.0467,0.0316,0.0404,0.0236,0.0431,0.0262,0.0227,0.0396,0.0316,0.0253,0.0307",https://images.pexels.com/photos/5598284/pexels-photo-5598284.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

475,hip-hop_dance,Hip-hop dance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop_dance,"Hip-hop dance is a fusion dance genre that incorporates elements of popping, locking, breaking, jazz, ballet, tap dancing and other styles and is typically performed to hip-hop, R&B, funk, electronic or pop music.
The term is also used as an exonym and umbrella term for various street dance styles either performed to hip-hop music or that have become associated with hip-hop culture. It includes a wide range of styles created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin', Beat Street and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; it gave these styles and hip-hop national exposure. 
The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called ""new style""—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called ""jazz-funk"". Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to create choreography from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development, hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces. The commercialization of hip-hop dance continued into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as The Grind, Planet B-Boy, Rize, StreetDance 3D, America's Best Dance Crew, Saigon Electric, the Step Up film series, and The LXD, a web series. Additional dance styles were developed during this time such as Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krump.
What distinguishes the hip-hop dance genre from its component styles is that in hip-hop dance the dancing is typically well-choreographed and is often performed as part of an ensemble. In contrast, its component styles such as breaking or popping are freestyle-oriented whether it's performed solo or as a group. The introduction hip-hop dance and its component styles outside the United States have resulted in dance showcases, dance classes and competitions that have helped maintain their presence and growth worldwide. There are several international hip-hop dance competitions such as the UK B-Boy Championships, Juste Debout, and EuroBattle. Australia hosts a team-based, competition called World Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan hosts a two-on-two competition called World Dance Colosseum.","African-American Culture,African-American Dance,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 French-Language Sources (Fr),Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Japanese-Language Sources (Ja),Cs1 Norwegian-Language Sources (No),Cs1 Portuguese-Language Sources (Pt),Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Dance Culture,Dances Of The United States,Good Articles,Hip Hop Dance,Short Description Is Different From Wikidata,Street Dance,Syllabus-Free Dance",Hip-hop_dance,Хип-хоп,"0.0193,0.0384,0.0452,0.0177,0.0172,0.3706,0.0378,0.014,0.1442,0.0177,0.0336,0.013,0.031,0.0156,0.0167,0.0362,0.0262,0.0209,0.0468,0.0378",https://images.pexels.com/photos/8853989/pexels-photo-8853989.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

हुक़्क़ा (Devanagari),  IPA: [ˈɦʊqːa]; also see other names), or shisha, is a single- or multi-stemmed instrument for heating or vaporizing and then smoking either tobacco, flavored tobacco (often Mu‘assel), or sometimes cannabis, hashish, and in the past opium. The smoke is passed through a water basin—often glass-based—before inhalation.The health risks of smoking through a hookah include exposure to toxic chemicals that are not filtered out by the water and risk of infectious disease when hookahs are shared.The hookah or waterpipe was invented by Abu’l-Fath Gilani, a Persian physician of Akbar, in the Indian city of Fatehpur Sikri during Mughal India; the hookah spread from the Indian subcontinent to Persia first, where the mechanism was modified to its current shape, and then to the Near East. Alternatively, it could have originated in the Safavid dynasty of Persia, from where it eventually spread to the Indian subcontinent.Despite tobacco and drug use being considered a taboo when the hookah was first conceived, its use became increasingly popular among nobility and subsequently widely accepted. Gradually, burned tobacco has been commonly replaced by vaporizing flavored shisha. Still the original hookah is often used in rural South Asia, which continues to use Tumbak (a pure and coarse form of unflavored tobacco leaves) and smoked by burning it directly with charcoal. While this method delivers a much higher content of tobacco and nicotine, it also imposes more adverse health effects compared to vaporized shisha hookahs.The word hookah is a derivative of ""huqqa"", a Hindustani word, of Arabic origin (derived from حُقَّة ḥuqqa, ""casket, bottle, water pipe""). Outside its native region, hookah smoking has gained popularity throughout the world, especially among younger people.","All Articles Lacking Reliable References,All Articles Needing Additional References,All Articles With Failed Verification,All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Arab Culture,Articles Containing Arabic-Language Text,Articles Containing Bengali-Language Text,Articles Containing Hebrew-Language Text,Articles Containing Persian-Language Text,Articles Containing Sanskrit-Language Text,Articles Containing Undetermined-Language Text,Articles Containing Video Clips,Articles Lacking Reliable References From June 2018,Articles Needing Additional References From July 2016,Articles With Failed Verification From May 2016,Articles With Short Description,Articles With Unsourced Statements From February 2012,Articles With Unsourced Statements From February 2016,Articles With Unsourced Statements From November 2012,Articles With Unsourced Statements From October 2020,Cs1: Long Volume Value,Cs1 German-Language Sources (De),Cs1 Spanish-Language Sources (Es),Cs1 Vietnamese-Language Sources (Vi),Commons Category Link From Wikidata,Desi Culture,Hindi Words And Phrases,Indian Inventions,Instances Of Lang-Bn Using Second Unnamed Parameter,Iranian Culture,Iranian Inventions,Nicotine Products With Harm-Reduction Claims,Pages Using Multiple Image With Auto Scaled Images,Pipe Smoking,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Smoking In India,Smoking In Pakistan,Tobacciana,Tobacco In Iran,Tobacco In Pakistan,Tobacco Smoking,Urdu-Language Words And Phrases,Use Dmy Dates From December 2020,Wikipedia Articles Incorporating A Citation From The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica With Wikisource Reference,Wikipedia Pending Changes Protected Pages",Hookah,Кальян,"0.0216,0.0322,0.0832,0.0308,0.0272,0.0379,0.0159,0.0697,0.069,0.0258,0.052,0.0159,0.2834,0.035,0.074,0.0301,0.0244,0.0173,0.0315,0.023",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4563735/pexels-photo-4563735.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940

Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities and/or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to give a meaning to life. Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that may also attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs.There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide. About 84% of the world's population is affiliated with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or some form of folk religion. The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics. While the religiously unaffiliated have grown globally, many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs.The study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, comparative religion and social scientific studies.

480,self-knowledge,Self-knowledge (psychology),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-knowledge_(psychology),"Self-knowledge is a term used in psychology to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding an answer to the question ""What am I like?"".
While seeking to develop the answer to this question, self-knowledge requires ongoing self-awareness and self-consciousness (which is not to be confused with consciousness). Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness and agency/contingency, yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of cognition, however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask ""What am I like?"", and to answer with self-knowledge, though self-knowledge has limits, as introspection has been said to be over-rated, limited, and complex.
Self-knowledge is a component of the self or, more accurately, the self-concept. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the desire to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept, even if that concept is flawed. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic, to the best that we can evaluate ourselves.
The self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects:

The cognitive self
The affective self
The executive selfThe affective and executive selves are also known as the felt and active selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept.
Self-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our true self; for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the known self. The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or think we know about ourselves). This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few.","All Articles With Unsourced Statements,Articles With Unsourced Statements From November 2009,Knowledge,Self,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers",Self-knowledge,Самопознание,"0.2458,0.0222,0.0608,0.0763,0.0341,0.0243,0.0158,0.0348,0.0172,0.0165,0.032,0.0503,0.0327,0.0186,0.0348,0.0285,0.0236,0.0193,0.0327,0.1797",https://images.pexels.com/photos/7129040/pexels-photo-7129040.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
481,improvisation,Improvisation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation,"Improvisation is the activity of making or doing something not planned beforehand, using whatever can be found. Improvisation in the performing arts is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines; see Applied improvisation.
Improvisation also exists outside the arts. Improvisation in engineering is to solve a problem with the tools and materials immediately at hand. Improvised weapons are often used by guerrillas, insurgents and criminals.","All Articles Needing Additional References,Articles Needing Additional References From November 2010,Articles With Curlie Links,Articles With Short Description,Cs1 Maint: Archived Copy As Title,Cinematic Techniques,Commons Category Link Is On Wikidata,Engineering Concepts,Improvisation,Music Genres,Poetic Devices,Sculpture Techniques,Short Description Matches Wikidata,Theatre,Use Dmy Dates From July 2020,Webarchive Template Warnings,Webarchive Template Wayback Links,Wikipedia Articles With Bnf Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Fast Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Gnd Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Lccn Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Ma Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Nara Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Sudoc Identifiers,Wikipedia Articles With Multiple Identifiers",Improvisation,Импровизация,"0.1809,0.029,0.0278,0.0833,0.0747,0.0451,0.1019,0.0278,0.05,0.0302,0.0327,0.0327,0.0451,0.0389,0.0451,0.0389,0.0278,0.0278,0.0315,0.029",https://images.pexels.com/photos/4786236/pexels-photo-4786236.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940
